It grows up to 30 ft tall, often much less. Its shape is very contorted in its native exposed coastal sites. In other environments it grows into a low dome shape with a clear sub canopy space. Leaves are double-compound, with 5-10 pairs of side-stalks, each with 15-25 pairs of leaflets. The individual leaflets are 7 mm long and 2 mm broad. Divi-Divi flowers during the warm weather, but the flowers are not very showy. They are yellow in color. The fruit is a twisted pod 5 cm long. Divi-divi is the national tree of Curacao and is very popular in Aruba where it is also called \\\"watapana\\\".
