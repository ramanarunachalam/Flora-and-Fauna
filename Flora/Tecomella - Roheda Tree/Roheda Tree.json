It occurs on flat and undulating areas including gentle hill slopes and sometimes also in ravines. It thrives very well on stabilized sand dunes, which experience extreme low and high temperatures. Leaves are narrow, somewhat lance-shaped, with wavy margins, 5-12 cm long. In spring time it produces beautiful showy tubular flowers in yellow, orange and red colours. Fruit is a long, thin, slightly curved capsule up to 20 cm long, with winged seeds. Roheda is mainly used as a source of timber. Its wood is strong, tough and durable. It takes a fine finish. The wood is excellent for firewood and charcoal. Cattle and goats eat leaves of the tree. Camels, goats and sheep consume flowers and pods. Roheda plays an important role in ecology. It acts as a soil-binding tree by spreading a network of lateral roots on the top surface of the soil. It acts as a windbreak and helps in stabilizing shifting sand dunes. It is considered as the home of birds and provides shelter for other desert wildlife. Shade of tree crown is shelter for the cattle, goats and sheep during summer days."]}, {"N": 20, "V": [0, "", ["India"]]}]}, {"CN": 7, "CV": [{"N": 12, "V": [0, "", "<b>English</b>: </i>Marwar teak, Desert teak, Honey tree</i>"]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 5]}, {"N": 11, "V": [0, "", "Color: Greyish"]}], "CI": "Tecomella - Roheda Tree/Roheda Tree - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 23, "V": [0, "", "trumpet"]}, {"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 6]}], "CI": "Tecomella - Roheda Tree/Roheda Tree - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 23, "V": [0, "", "Capsule"]}]}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 32, "V": [1, 4, 10]}, {"N": 31, "V": [0, "", "Feathery"]}, {"N": 13, "V": [0, "", "5-7"]}, {"N": 16, "V": [0, "", "odd"]}], "CI": "Tecomella - Roheda Tree/Roheda Tree - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [], "mapregion": []}
