The trees have a long life, and may live up to one hundred years of age. The tree is variable in habit, usually upright to sprawling, and may intertwine with other species. The plant parasitises the roots of other tree species, but without major detriment to its hosts. The reddish or brown bark can be almost black and is smooth in young trees, becoming cracked with a red reveal. The heartwood is pale green to white as the common name indicates. The oval leaves are thin, oppositely arranged. Smooth surface is shiny and bright green, with a glaucous pale underside. Fruit is produced after three years, viable seeds after five. These seeds are distributed by birds. Sandalwood oil was used traditionally to treat skin diseases, acne, dysentery, gonorrhea, and a number of other conditions.1 In traditional Chinese medicine, sandalwood oil is considered an excellent sedating agent.", "Where": ["cambridge road, ulsoor, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Language Common": "Sandalwood, Indian sandalwood, Fragrant sandalwood, White Sandalwood", "Name": "Sandalwood Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "green turning deep purple", "Genus": "Santalum", "Flowers Color": "purplish brown", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santalum_album", "Bark Color": "reddish brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Sandalwood.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?33075", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-28500042"], "Family": "Santalaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Height": "4-9 m", "Flowers Season": "Jun-Jul", "Images": ["Sandalwood Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit Bunch", "Fruit Tender 1", "Fruit Tender 2", "Fruit", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": "India", "Species": "album", "Size": "Small"}
