{"Common Family": "Eucalyptus", "Where": ["Dickenson Road, Ulsoor, Bangalore", "Old Airport Road, Kodihalli, Bangalore"], "Leaves Size": "18 cm", "Fruits Shape": "funnel capsule", "Description": "Forest Red Gum is the most common eucalyptus, widely planted in India. It grows to a height of 20-50 m, and a trunk girth of up to 2 m. The trunk is straight, and is usually unbranched for more than half of the total height of the tree. Thereafter, limbs are unusually steeply inclined for a Eucalyptus species. The bark is shed in irregular sheets, resulting in a smooth trunk surface colored in patches of white, gray and blue, corresponding to areas that shed their bark at different times. It has narrow, lanceshaped green leaves, from 10-20 cm long, and 1-3 cm wide. Flowers occur in inflorescences of 7-11 flowers. Flowers buds are like long cones, longer than most eucalyptus species. The caps fall off to reveal the flowers which are mostly stamens. Fruit is a small woody capsule with protruding teeth.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "Forest Red Gum Tree", "Leaves Type": "Lance", "Fruits Size": "small", "Genus": "Eucalyptus", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_tereticornis", "Bark Color": "dark", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Forest%20Red%20Gum.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?16042", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-74009"], "Family": "Myrtaceae", "Flowers Size": "1 cm", "Authority": "Sm.", "Flowers Season": "May-Jun", "Bark Texture": "very rough", "Images": ["Forest Red Gum Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Australia", "Species": "tereticornis", "Size": "Medium"}
