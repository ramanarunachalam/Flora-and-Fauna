The upper surface is harshly hairy, the undersurface covered in dense woolly hairs, obscuring the net-veining. The flowerheads are star-shaped, forming large terminal clusters, mauve when young but soon turning white, appearing in winter. The body of the achene is covered in papillae but lacks hairs (apart from the pappus).", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?41206", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/gcc-134092"], "Name": "Lowveld Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "unknown", "Genus": "Vernonia", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernonia_colorata", "Bark Color": "brown", "Family": "Asteraceae", "Habitat": "In open woodland, in riverine fringes.", "Authority": "(Willd.)
