Interestingly enough it smells like garlic. However, it doesn't smell if the plant is left alone, only when the leaves are crushed. It can either be described as a shrub or a vine since it produces numerous woody vines from the root that grow only 2-3 m tall and form a shrub-like appearance. It produces bright green leaves up to 15 cm long. Its compact habitat and pretty continuos flowers make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens in the tropics. Flowering twice a year you will find it quite often covered with flowers. Flowers start off purple with white throat and change to a lighter shade of lavender with age. Eventually fading to almost white. You will see 3 different color of flowers at the same time on the plant. It can be grown in containers and should be trimmed after the flowers are gone."]}, {"N": 37, "V": [0, "", ["South America"]]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 4]}]}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 8]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: purple to lavendar to white"]}], "CI": "Mansoa - Garlic Vine/Garlic Vine - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 45, "V": [0, "", "unknown"]}]}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 59, "V": [1, 4, 11]}], "CI": "Mansoa - Garlic Vine/Garlic Vine - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [], "mapregion": []}
