The beautiful & fragrant,                 classic, Orchid-like flowers of Bauhinia purpurea makes this small tree, native to India, a favourite of many plant                 lovers. In fall, before the leaves drop, Orchid-Tree is festooned with many showy and delightfully fragrant,                 five-inch-wide blossoms, the narrow purple, pink, and lavender petals arranged to closely resemble an orchid. These                 flowers appear on the trees from September through November and are a beautiful sight to see, creating a vivid splash of                 color in the autumn landscape. Curiously, the flower colors varies quite a lot. There are some trees which have white                 flowers with only some streaks of purple in them. Purple orchid tree can be easily distinguished from Orchid Tree                 (Bauhinia variegata) in that the petals of Purple orchid tree are narrower and do not overlap. On the other hand, the petals of Bauhinia variegata are broad and overlap - it never open fully flat. The flowers are followed by 12-inch-long,                 slender, brown, flat seedpods which usually persist on the tree throughout the winter. The foliage light green and deeply                 notched at the tip. Bauhinia purpurea can reach up to 20 feet tall and have a 25 foot crown.", "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Fruits Info": "thin flat pod", "Name": "Purple Butterfly Tree", "Leaves Type": "2 lobed", "Bark Texture": "not rough", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Size": "28 cm", "Genus": "Bauhinia", "Flowers Color": "lilac", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhinia_purpurea", "Bark Color": "Ashy", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Purple%20Orchid%20Tree.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?6590", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-823"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Locale": {"Hindi": ["Kaniar"], "Common": ["Purple orchid tree"]}, "Leaves Info": "Slightly longer than broad", "Authority": "L.", "Height": "17 m", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Mar, Jun-Oct", "Leaves Shape": "Camel hoof", "Images": ["Purple Butterfly Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Bunch", "Flower", "Fruit Falling", "Fruit New", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["India"], "Flowers Info": "5 narrow petals", "Species": "Purpurea", "Size": "Small"}
