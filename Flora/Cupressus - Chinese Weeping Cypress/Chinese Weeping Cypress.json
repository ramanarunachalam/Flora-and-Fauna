The foliage grows in dense, usually moderately decumbent and pendulous sprays of bright green, very slender, slightly flattened shoots. The leaves are scale-like, 1-2 mm long, up to 5 mm long on strong lead shoots; young trees up to about 5-10 years old have juvenile foliage with soft needle-like leaves 3-8 mm long. The seed cones are globose, 8-15 mm long, with 6-10 scales (usually 8), green, maturing dark brown about 24 months after pollination. The cones open at maturity to shed the seed. The pollen cones are 3-5 mm long, and release pollen in early spring.", "Genus": "Cupressus", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "funebris", "Native": "China"}
