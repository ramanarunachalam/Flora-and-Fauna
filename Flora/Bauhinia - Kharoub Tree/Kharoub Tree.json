Leaves very small, bilobate almost to the base, with semi-circular lobes, glabrous, with long petioles, greyish-green, less than 3 cm long. Flowers greenish-yellow to white and pale pink, in few-flowered racemes; petals 5, spathulate, 15-20 mm long; stamens 10, filaments hairy at the base. Fruits aggregated, long, narrow pods, twisted, up to 10 cm long, glabrous, obliquely constricted, shining dark red-brown, with 4-10 seeds each. Pods remain on the shrub for a long time. The generic name commemorates Swiss botanists Jean (1541-1613) and Gaspard (1560-1624) Bauhin.
