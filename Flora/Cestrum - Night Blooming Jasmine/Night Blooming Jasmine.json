Vine-like stems reach up to 12' in its native habitat, but it seldom reaches more than a 4' mound in a single season. It blooms in cycles throughout warm weather. Greenish-creamy white tubular flowers rise from above leaves along the stem, followed by shiny white, fleshy berries. Although the flowers are not showy to the eye, their sweet scent can overpower. The perfume is distinctly powerful at night - this feature has had its influence on its common name in all languages. The Hindi name translates to queen of the night, while the Manipuri name means moon flower. No fragrant garden should be without this nocturnal beauty. While night blooming jasmine is a gorgeous plant with charming blooms, the scent also produces severe allergic reactions in some individuals."]}, {"N": 38, "V": [0, "", ["Asia"]]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 4]}], "CI": "Cestrum - Night Blooming Jasmine/Night Blooming Jasmine - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 10]}, {"N": 19, "V": [0, "", "Fragrant at night"]}], "CI": "Cestrum - Night Blooming Jasmine/Night Blooming Jasmine - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 46, "V": [0, "", "unknown"]}]}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 60, "V": [1, 4, 11]}], "CI": "Cestrum - Night Blooming Jasmine/Night Blooming Jasmine - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [], "mapregion": []}
