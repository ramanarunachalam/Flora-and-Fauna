The leaves are pinnate, with an 8-16 cm petiole and three leaflets, each leaflet 10-20 cm long. t is seen in all its ugliness in December and January when most of the leaves fall: but from January to March it truly becomes a tree of flame, a riot of orange and vermilion flowers covering the entire crown. These flowers, which are scentless, are massed along the ends of the stalks--dark velvety green like the cup-shaped calices--and the brilliance of the stiff, bright flowers is shown off to perfection by this deep, contrasting colour. Each flower consists of five petals comprising one standard, two smaller wings and a very curved beak-shaped keel. It is this keel which gives it the name of Parrot Tree. In olden days, the flowers of Tesu were used to make color for the festival of Holi. In Manipur, there is an interesting cultural use of the wood of this tree with beautiful flowers - when a member of the Meitei community dies and, for some reasons, his body cannot be be found, the wood of this tree is cremated in place of the body.", "Language Hindi": "dhak, palash, tesu, kesu, chhichra", "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Faboideae", "Language Common": "bastard teak, bengal kino", "Name": "Flame of the Forest Tree", "Leaves Type": "trifoliate", "Bark Texture": "Flaky", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Language Latin": "Butea frondosa", "Fruits Size": "20 cm", "Genus": "Butea", "Flowers Color": "Bright Orange", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butea_monosperma", "Bark Color": "Pale Brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Flame%20of%20the%20Forest.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?8177", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-30638"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "(Lam.)
