Jerusalem thorn has peculiar straplike, twice compound leaves that look like long, feathery streamers. The leaves appear shortly after rain, they fold up at night, and usually within a few days the tiny leaflets drop off, leaving the persistent rachises (midribs) to flutter like streamers in the wind. Flowers are yellow and fragrant, 2 cm in diameter, growing from a long slender stalk in groups of 8-10. Though the plant can flower all year round the main flowering period is October.", "Where": ["Vignana Nagara, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduos", "Sub Family": "Mimosoideae", "Spines Shape": "straight", "Name": "Jerusalem thorn Tree", "Leaves Type": "bipinnate", "Fruits Color": "green to brown", "Genus": "Parkinsonia", "Flowers Color": "yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonia_aculeata", "Bark Color": "grey", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Jerusalem%20Thorn.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?26783", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-1649"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Flowers Season": "Oct-Nov", "Images": ["Jerusalem Thorn Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf", "Spine"]], "Native": "India", "Species": "aculeata", "Size": "Small"}
