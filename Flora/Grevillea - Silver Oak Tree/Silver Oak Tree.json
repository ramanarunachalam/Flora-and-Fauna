It is a fast growing evergreen tree, between 18-35 m tall with dark green delicately dented bipinnatifid leaves reminiscent of a fern frond. These leaves are generally 15-30 cm long with silvery undersides. Its flowers are golden-orange bottlebrush-like blooms, between 8-15 cm long, in the spring, on a 2-3 cm long stem. A great quantity of leaves fall in the spring immediately preceding the emergence of new growth and leaves also fall sporadically throughout the year, creating quite a litter problem to some people. Black, leathery seed capsules follow the flowers.", "Where": ["Behind ESI hospital, Indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Semi Evergreen", "Language Common": "golden pine, silky pine", "Name": "Silver Oak Tree", "Leaves Type": "paripinnate", "Fruits Color": "black", "Genus": "Grevillea", "Flowers Color": "orange yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grevillea_robusta", "Bark Color": "nearly black", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Silver%20Oak.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?18006", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2832700"], "Family": "Proteaceae", "Authority": "A.Cunn. ex R.Br.", "Height": "30 m", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Mar", "Images": ["Silver Oak Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "0024", "0025", "0026", "0027", "0028", "0029", "Bark", "Branch", "Canopy", "Flower Bud 1", "Flower Bud 2", "Flower Bunch", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf"]], "Flowers Shape": "brush like spikes", "Native": "Australia", "Species": "Robusta", "Size": "Tall"}
