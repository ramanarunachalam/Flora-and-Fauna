Native to tropical America, it has spread to many tropical countries because of the ease with which it can be grown and for its beautiful appearance. Ideal for covering trellises and growing in pots over \"balloons,\" Skyblue Clustervine is a small freely blooming creeper of controllable growth. The stem of the creeper is slender and green and the leaves are arranged alternatively. The leaves are small, shiny and heart-shaped with pointed tips. The bell-shaped white-throated ultramarine blue flowers are produced in clusters at the ends for long stalks. The creeper looks gorgeous with its many flowers spread on it after rains and in the cooler season. Compared to other members of morning glory family, the flowers are smaller. They are about the size of a one-rupee coin or 2.5 cms across, with the petals fixing into bell shape with five stamens.", "Language Common": "Skyblue Clustervine, Pentantha", "Genus": "Jacquemontia", "Type": "Climber", "Species": "pentanthos", "Native": "Tropical America"}
