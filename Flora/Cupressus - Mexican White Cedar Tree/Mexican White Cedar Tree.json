The seed cones are globose to oblong, 10\u201320 mm long, with four to 10 scales, green at first, maturing brown or grey-brown about 25 months after pollination. The cones may either open at maturity to release the seeds, or remain closed for several years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, allowing the seeds to colonise the bare ground exposed by the fire.
