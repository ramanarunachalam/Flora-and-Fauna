The stem is woody, irregular, and of branches with spines that form a layer without definite form and die after the flowering. The flowers, arranged in inflorescences of the raceme type, are pentameric, complete, and of bilateral symmetry. Their color is red. Its calyx (all the sepals together) is like a little thimble of red color. Sepals and petals are of similar color, unlike Indian Coral Tree in which the sepals are green. The petals called wings are very small; they are practically hidden within the calyx. The other two petals sometimes partially weld together, and form the keel or carina, serving as protection for the organs of reproduction.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Sub Family": "Faboideae", "Language Common": "Cockspur Coral Tree", "Name": "Erythrina crista gali", "Leaves Type": "trifoliate", "Fruits Color": "chestnut brown", "Genus": "Erythrina", "Flowers Color": "Red", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrina_crista-galli", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Cockspur%20Coral%20Tree.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?15739", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-2683"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Height": "5-8 m", "Flowers Season": "Jun-Sep", "Bark Texture": "irregular", "Images": ["Cockspur Coral Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "Bark", "Branch", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Bunch", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit Seed", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Argentina, Uruguay", "Species": "Crista-galli", "Size": "Small"}
