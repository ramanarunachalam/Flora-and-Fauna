Frangipani is well-known for its intensely fragrant, lovely, spiral-shaped blooms which appear at branch tips. The tree itself is rather unusual in appearance. The 20-inch-long, coarse, deciduous leaves are clustered only at the tips of the rough, blunt, sausage-like, thick, grey-green branches. Branches are upright and rather crowded on the trunk forming a vase or umbrella shape with age. They are rather soft and brittle and can break but are usually sturdy unless they are mechanically hit or disturbed. A milky sap is exuded from the branches when they are bruised or punctured.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Fruits Info": "shiny two pods with joint end", "Language Common": "temple tree, pagoda tree", "Name": "Common White Frangipani Tree", "Leaves Type": "obovate", "Fruits Color": "deep green to black", "Genus": "Plumeria", "Flowers Color": "white with yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumeria_rubra", "Bark Color": "Greenish Brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Common%20White%20Frangipani.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?28884", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-161631"], "Family": "Apocynaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Height": "7-8 m", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Oct", "Images": ["Common White Frangipani Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Central America", "Flowers Info": "fragrant, white with yellow eye", "Species": "rubra", "Size": "Small"}
