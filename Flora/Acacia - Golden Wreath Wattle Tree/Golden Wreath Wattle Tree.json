{"Common Family": "pea", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Description": "Acacia saligna grows as a small, dense, spreading tree with a short trunk and a weeping habit. It grows up to eight metres tall. Like many Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves; these can be up to 25 centimetres long. At the base of each phyllode is a nectary gland, which secretes a sugary fluid. This attracts ants, which are believed to reduce the numbers of leaf-eating insects. The yellow flowers appear in early spring and late winter, in groups of up to ten bright yellow spherical flower heads. The fruit is a legume, while the seed is oblong and dark to black in colour.[", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Mimosoideae", "Language Common": "coojong, golden wreath wattle, orange wattle, blue-leafed wattle, Western Australian golden wattle, Port Jackson willow", "Name": "Golden Wreath Wattle Tree", "Leaves Type": "phyllode", "Fruits Color": "brown", "Genus": "Acacia", "Flowers Color": "yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_saligna", "Bark Color": "grey", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?981", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-591"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "(Labill.)
