It is described as a long leathery, linear-oblong obtuse-leaved tree. Spolia Zeylanica (1909, p 153) says that this tree occurs sparingly by the rivers. The tree may grow up to 30-40 feet high. Its wood, pink or pinkish white in colour, is moderately hard and is used for building. The wood also is said to be durable in water. The tree sprouts twice a year in February and in September and the young foliage is brownish red in colour.", "Genus": "Mischodon", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "zeylanicus", "Native": ["Sri Lanka", "S.
