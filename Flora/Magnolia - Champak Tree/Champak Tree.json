It occurs naturally in the eastern Himalayan region. It is a large evergreen tree with a long straight bole of 18-21 m with a close tapering crown composed of ascending branches. The most interesting part of the tree are its flowers which are not very showy with few narrow yellowish white petals, but have an extremely heady fragrance. This fragrance has made Champa flowers very popular and they have been part of the culture in India from time immemorial. They are used in religeous offering in various parts of India. On a warm humid night, the scents can easily be enjoyed several hundred feet away. Champa flowers are used to make the world's most expensive perfume 'Joy' in America.", "Language Hindi": "Champa", "Grow Type": "Semi Evergreen", "Language Kannada": "Samipge", "Language Common": "Joy Perfume Tree", "Name": "Champak Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Genus": "Magnolia", "Flowers Color": "Yellowish White", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelia_champaca", "Bark Color": "Ashy Grey", "Type": "Tree", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Champa.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?452629", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-252903"], "Family": "Magnoliaceae", "Language Tamil": "Sambagan", "Authority": "(DC.)
