{"Common Family": "Gulmohar", "Type": "Tree", "Leaflet Numbers": "2", "Description": "The dwarf white bauhinia is native to Asia. This is a perfect little tree for places where you don't want anything wild to take over. It will grow no more than two or three meters, and won't take up much space or get in anyone's way. It really is quite inoffensive. Beautiful white flowers cover this tree in spring and fill the air with a sweet clean fragrance. The white flowers look like snowflakes hanging on the branches. Sometimes it is called Snowy Orchid Tree. The leaves are shaped a little like a cow's hoof.", "Where": ["Cambridge Road, Ulsoor, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Fruits Info": "thin flat pod", "Name": "Dwarf White Orchid Tree", "Leaves Type": "2 lobed", "Bark Texture": "not rough", "Genus": "Bauhinia", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhinia_acuminata", "Bark Color": "Ashy", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Dwarf%20White%20Orchid%20Tree.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?6551", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-13027183"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Flowers Season": "Jul-Oct", "Leaves Shape": "Camel hoof", "Images": ["Dwarf White Orchid Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud 1", "Flower Bud 2", "Flower", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["India"], "Flowers Info": "5 narrow petals", "Species": "acuminata", "Size": "Small"}
