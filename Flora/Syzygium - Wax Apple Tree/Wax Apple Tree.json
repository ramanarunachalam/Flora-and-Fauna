They are nearly stalkless, elliptic- oblong, rounded or slightly heart-shaped at the base, yellowish to dark bluish-green. The flowers are white, 2.5 cm diameter, with four petals and numerous long stamens. The fruit is a bell-shaped edible berry, with colors ranging from white, pale green, green, red, purple, crimson, to deep purple or even black, 4-6 cm long in wild plants. The flowers and resulting fruit are not limited to the axils of the leaves and can appear on nearly any point on the surface of the trunk and branches. When mature, the tree is considered a heavy bearer and can yield a crop of up to 700 fruits. The tree is indigenous from Malaya to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where there are wild trees in the coastal forests.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Name": "Wax Apple Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Genus": "Syzygium", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_samarangense", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Wax%20Apple.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?312990", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-200262"], "Family": "Myrtaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Wax apple", "Wax jambu", "Water apple", "Mountain apple", "Cloud apple", "Jambu air", "Java apple"]}, "Authority": "(Blume) Merr. & L.
