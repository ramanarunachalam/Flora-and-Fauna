{"Common Family": "coffee", "Type": "Shrub", "Fruits Shape": "shperical", "Description": "The mussaenda is an evergreen shrub related to coffee trees and native to Asia. It may be a rather small shrub, or large to 30 feet, like a small tree. Commercial nurseries often train mussaenda to be tree-like in form for landscape use. Their natural habit is to produce many stems and it is quite a rambler. It has silky, hairy, soft medium-green leaves. The plant's color comes from bracts and not the small, often yellow, white or orange, flowers at the center of each bract. This is the same color-producing system used by tropicals such heliconia and bougainvillea. Bracts may be seen in several colors including rose, white, red, pale pink and some mixtures.", "Flowers Color": "orange", "Grow Type": "evergreen", "Fruits Info": "grooved", "Name": "Orange Mussaenda", "Fruits Texture": "velvety", "Leaves Type": "ovate", "Genus": "Mussaenda", "Where": ["80 ft Road, Indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussaenda_marmelada", "Bark Color": "grey brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Mussaenda.html"], "Family": "Rubiaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Mussaenda", "Ashanti blood", "Red flag bush", "Tropical dogwood"]}, "Authority": "Schumach.", "Flowers Season": "Mar-Apr", "Images": ["Orange Mussaenda", ["0000", "0001", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["Asia"], "Species": "cv.
