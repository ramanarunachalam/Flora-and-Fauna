The young leaves start intensely red, and turn more and more green when reaching their ultimate size of up to 50 cm length. It is a tree 5-10 m tall, with crown wide, and a bole diameter of 10-15 cm. Bark is gray, smooth. Branchlets are sparsely pubescent. Stipules, falling off soon, are ovate-lanceolate, 1-1.5 cm. Leaves are alternately arranged, carried on 4-6 cm long stalks. They are obovate-elliptic to elliptic, 12-25  6-23 cm, papery, densely small tuberculate on the underside, hairless above, base shallowly heart-shaped to broadly wedge-shaped, margin irregularly toothed. Figs are clustered on short branchlets of old stems, dark red when mature, pear-shaped to spherical, with 4-6 longitudinal ridges and small tubercles. They are large for figs, 2-3.5 cm in diameter, covered with soft hairs. Figs are edible and sweet. In Meghalaya, fruits are eaten raw, leaves are lopped for highly palatable fodder. Elephant Ear Fig is found in the Himalayas, from Nepal to NE India, Burma, S. China, Indo-China and Malaya, at altitudes of 1000-2100 m.\", \"Grow Type\": \"Deciduous\", \"Language Common\": \"Elephant Ear Fig, Roxburgh fig\", \"Figs Shape\": \"cone\", \"Name\": \"Elephant Ear Fig Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"oval\", \"Figs Info\": \"green to red in color.\", \"Figs Season\": \"Oct-Nov\", \"Genus\": \"Ficus\", \"Where\": [\"9th Cross Road, 6th Main ROad, Defence Colony, Indiranagar, Bangalore\"], \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_auriculata\", \"Bark Color\": \"Greyish yellow\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Elephant%20Ear%20Fig.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?16777\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2809581\"], \"Family\": \"Moraceae\", \"Authority\": \"Lour.\", \"Figs Size\": \"2-3 cm\", \"Images\": [\"Elephant Ear Fig Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"Aerial Root\", \"Bark\", \"Canopy\", \"Fig Tender 1\", \"Fig Tender 2\", \"Fig Tender\", \"Fig\", \"Leaf New\", \"Leaf Tender 1\", \"Leaf Tender 2\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Native\": \"India, Malaya\", \"Species\": \"auriculata\", \"Size\": \"Medium\"}"
