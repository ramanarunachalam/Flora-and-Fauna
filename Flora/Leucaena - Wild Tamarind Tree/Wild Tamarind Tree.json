Leaves are like that of tamarind. It is a thornless shrubby bush or tree often only to 6-8ft but occasionally to 30-60ft. Grows very well in arid tropical climates and can become a pest species in such climates. Grows best under full sun, needs little water or care once established. Very fast grower. Grows in practically any soil type. The tree has a huge wealth of uses, and is an extremely fast-grower, but care should be taken in some regions to control growth as the seeds are easily dispersed by birds and grazing cattle and the tree has the potential to become a pest. It is grown for fodder, but unless severely grazed or controlled, it spreads rampantly throughout adjacent areas.", "Where": ["Near Jogpalya Park, Ulsoor, Bangalore", "13th Cross, II Stage, Indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Mimosoideae", "Name": "Wild Tamarind Tree", "Leaves Type": "bipinnate", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Size": "18 cm", "Fruits Color": "green turning reddish brown", "Genus": "Leucaena", "Flowers Color": "White or creamy", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucaena_leucocephala", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Wild%20Tamarind.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?21959", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-105"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Jumbie bean", "White popinac", "Lead tree", "Subabool tree", "Ipli ipli"]}, "Flowers Size": "2 cm", "Authority": "(Lam.) de Wit", "Flowers Season": "Jun-Jul", "Bark Texture": "smooth", "Images": ["Wild Tamarind Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "0024", "0025", "0026", "Bark", "Branch", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Bunch 1", "Flower Bunch 2", "Flower", "Fruit Tender 1", "Fruit Tender 2", "Fruit Tender 3", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["Central America"], "Species": "Leucocephala", "Size": "Medium"}
