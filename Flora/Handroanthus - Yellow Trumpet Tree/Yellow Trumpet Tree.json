{"Common Family": "Jacaranda", "Type": "Tree", "Leaflet Numbers": "5-7", "Description": "An ideal patio, specimen, or lawn tree, Yellow Trumpet Tree is often seen as a small, 15 to 25-foot-tall tree but can potentially reach taller, with a rounded, spreading canopy in a wind-protected area. Sometimes evergreen but most often deciduous, Yellow Trumpet Tree has four-inch-long silvery-green leaves with tan, fuzzy undersides. These leaves drop as new foliage emerges in spring, and it is at this time that the trees put on their heaviest flowering display, the trumpet-shaped, bright yellow blossoms appearing in dense 2.5 to 8-inch-long terminal clusters. . The eight-inch-long seed capsules which follow are brown, hairy, and persist on the tree through the winter.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Name": "Yellow Trumpet Tree", "Leaves Type": "palmately Compound", "Fruits Shape": "capsule", "Fruits Color": "pale brown", "Genus": "Handroanthus", "Flowers Color": "bright yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handroanthus_umbellatus", "Bark Color": "pale grey", "Links": ["http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-317157"], "Family": "Bignoniaceae", "Authority": "(Sond.)
