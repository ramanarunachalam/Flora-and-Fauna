It is a fan palm with large palmate leaves up to 5 m in diameter, with a petiole up to 4 m, and up to 130 leaflets. The Talipot palm bears the largest inflorescence of any plant, 6-8 m long, consisting of one to several million small flowers borne on a branched stalk that forms at the top of the trunk. The Talipot palm is monocarpic, flowering only once, when it is 30 to 80 years old. It takes about a year for the fruit to mature, producing thousands of round yellow-green fruit 3-4 cm diameter, containing a single seed. The plant dies after fruiting. The Talipot palm is cultivated throughout southeast Asia, north to southern China. Historically, the leaves were written upon in various Southeast Asian cultures using an iron stylus to create palm leaf manuscripts. The leaves are also used for thatching, and the sap is tapped to make palm wine.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "Talipot Palm Tree", "Leaves Type": "fan", "Fruits Shape": "fig like", "Fruits Color": "yellow green", "Genus": "Corypha", "Flowers Color": "Creamy", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corypha_umbraculifera", "Bark Color": "Grey", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Talipot%20Palm.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?11676", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-48259"], "Family": "Arecaceae", "Flowers Size": "6-8 m", "Authority": "L.", "Height": "25 m", "Flowers Season": "Once", "Leaves Shape": "fan", "Images": ["Talipot Palm Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "0024", "0025", "Bark Young", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit Bunch", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf Falling", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["S.
