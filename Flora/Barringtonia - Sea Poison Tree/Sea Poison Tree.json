It has large leaves held in rosettes at the ends of branches. The leaves are narrow obovate, 20\u201340 cm long and 10\u201320 cm broad. The young leaves are a beautiful bronze with pinkish veins. Old leaves turn yellowish. The flowers are delightful puff balls of white stamens tipped with pink. They open at night and attract large moths and nectar-feeding bats with their heavy scent. The next morning, the flower stamens are usually found strewn beneath the tree. The fruits have a typical lantern shape and float on the water. The fruit can survive drifting on the sea for long distances and for periods of up to 2 years. All parts of the tree contain, saponin, a poison. The seeds and other parts of the plant are pounded, pulped or grated to release the poison and used to stun fish in freshwater streams. The floating seeds are sometimes used as fishing floats."]}, {"N": 37, "V": [0, "", ["Sri Lanka", "Indonesia", "Australia", "Philippines"]]}]}, {"CN": 7, "CV": [{"N": 31, "V": [0, "", "</i>\u0d28\u0d40\u0d7c\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d47\u0d34\u0d4d, Barringtonia speciosa</i>"]}, {"N": 53, "V": [0, "", "</i>\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb4 \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd</i>"]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 2]}, {"N": 56, "V": [0, "", "not rough"]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: grey brown"]}], "CI": "Barringtonia - Sea Poison Tree/Sea Poison Tree - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 7]}, {"N": 43, "V": [0, "", "Feb-Mar"]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: Pinkish white"]}], "CI": "Barringtonia - Sea Poison Tree/Sea Poison Tree - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 47, "V": [0, "", "15 cm"]}, {"N": 45, "V": [0, "", "woody capsule"]}, {"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 4]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: Green to Grey"]}], "CI": "Barringtonia - Sea Poison Tree/Sea Poison Tree - Fruit.jpg"}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 59, "V": [1, 4, 11]}], "CI": "Barringtonia - Sea Poison Tree/Sea Poison Tree - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [{"lat": "12.977188951", "long": "77.5975070715"}, {"lat": "12.992738636549504", "long": "77.60995325906458"}], "mapregion": [["12.977188951", "77.5975070715"], ["12.992738636549504", "77.60995325906458"]]}
