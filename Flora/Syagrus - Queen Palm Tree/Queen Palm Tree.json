Syagrus romanzoffiana (Queen Palm or Cocos Palm) is a palm native to South America, from northern Argentina north to eastern Brazil and west to eastern Bolivia. It is very similar to the coconut palm. It had been classified within the Cocos genus as Cocos plumosa, was assigned to Arecastrum, then moved to Syagrus. As a result of the nomenclature confusion, they often retain a previous, incorrect name in popular usage. It is a medium-sized palm, quickly reaching maturity at a height of up to 15 metres tall, with pinnate leaves.  The Queen Palm is found in most tropical and subtropical areas.
