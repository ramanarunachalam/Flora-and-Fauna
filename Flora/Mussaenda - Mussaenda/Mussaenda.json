{"Common Family": "coffee", "Type": "Shrub", "Fruits Shape": "shperical", "Description": "The mussaenda is an evergreen shrub related to coffee trees and native to Asia. It may be a rather small shrub, or large to 30 feet, like a small tree. Commercial nurseries often train mussaenda to be tree-like in form for landscape use. Their natural habit is to produce many stems and it is quite a rambler. It has silky, hairy, soft medium-green leaves. The plant's color comes from bracts and not the small, often yellow, white or orange, flowers at the center of each bract. This is the same color-producing system used by tropicals such heliconia and bougainvillea. Bracts may be seen in several colors including rose, white, red, pale pink and some mixtures.", "Flowers Color": "white and pink", "Grow Type": "evergreen", "Fruits Info": "grooved", "Language Common": "Mussaenda, Ashanti Blood, Red Flag Bush, Tropical Dogwood", "Name": "Mussaenda", "Fruits Texture": "velvety", "Leaves Type": "ovate", "Genus": "Mussaenda", "Where": ["12A Main Road, Indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussaenda_erythrophylla", "Bark Color": "grey brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Mussaenda.html"], "Family": "Rubiaceae", "Authority": "Schumach.", "Flowers Season": "Mar-Apr", "Images": ["Mussaenda", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Asia", "Species": "erythrophylla", "Size": "Small"}
