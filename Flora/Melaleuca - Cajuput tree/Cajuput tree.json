The botanical species name also comes from from the Greek leukos (white) and dendron (tree). The tree has a long flexible trunk with irregular ascending branches, covered with a pale thick, lamellated bark it is soft and spongy and from time to time throws off its outer layer in flakes; leaves entire, linear, lanceolate, ash colour, alternate on short foot-stalks. White stalkless flowers occur on long spikes, reminiscent of bottle-brush. The leaves have a very aromatic odour and the oil is distilled from the fresh leaves and twigs, and is volatile and stimulating with an aroma like camphor, rosemary, or cardamom seeds.", "Genus": "Melaleuca", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "cajuputi", "Native": ["Australia"]}
