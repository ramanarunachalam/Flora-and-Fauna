{"Common Family": "Pomegranate", "Type": "Tree", "Description": "The pomegranate is a shrub, usually with multiple stems, that commonly grows 6-15 ft tall. The slender branches start out upright, then droop gracefully. Pomegranates have beautiful orange-red trumpet shaped flowers with ruffled petals. From one to several flowers may be borne on a twig, one being terminal, the others lateral and solitary. The odorless but colorful flowers are large, 1 1/2 to 3 inches in length, campanulate or cylindrical, and generally reddish but sometimes yellow to white. There are five or more petals, some of which may be doubled. The stamens are numerous, erect to slightly curved at the apex, and red - the anthers are yellow.", "Where": ["3rd cross road, domlur, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Name": "Pomegranate Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "orange", "Genus": "Punica", "Flowers Color": "orange red", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate", "Bark Color": "grey or grey brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Pomegranate.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?30372", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-26700001"], "Family": "Punicaceae", "Locale": {"Hindi": ["Anar"]}, "Authority": "L.", "Flowers Season": "May-Oct", "Images": ["Pomegranate Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf"]], "Flowers Shape": "funnel", "Native": ["Africa"], "Species": "Granatum", "Size": "Small"}
