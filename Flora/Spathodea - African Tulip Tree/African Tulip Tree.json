It may grow to 80 ft on an ideal site, but most specimens are much                    smaller. The tree has a stout, tapering, somewhat buttressed trunk covered in warty light gray bark. The lateral                          branches are short and thick. The 1-2 ft long opposite leaves, which emerge a bronzy color, are massed at the ends of                     the branches. They are composed of 5-19 deeply veined oval leaflets. The horn shaped velvety olive buds appear in                         upturned whorls at the branch tips. A few at a time, the buds of the lowest tier bend outward and open into big                           crinkled red orange tuliplike bells with red streaked gold throats, frilly yellow edges, and four brown-anthered                          stamens in the center. They are followed by 5-10 in green brown fingerlike pods pointing upwards and outwards above the                   foliage. Each of these pods contains about 500 tissue papery seeds. The tree flowers in spurts all through the growing                    season, but peak bloom is usually in the spring\\nAlmost suddenly this species seems to have come into bloom all over\\ntown. It is a grand sight particularly where they have been planted at the boundary of parks.\\nA handsome tree bears dark green leaves most of the year. It is in bloom for a long duration\\nproviding many birds with nectar from its cup shaped deep-orange flowers. The flowers in\\nclusters held clear off the foliage are in contrast to the green foliage. It is not unusual to\\nfind buds of various ages, flowers, and erect, green seed cases in the same cluster. Children\\nsquirt the liquid in the buds at each other. The seed cases when mature, become brown and\\nwoody. A large transparent, polythene-like, appendage surrounds the tiny brown seed that\\nfloat in the air before reaching the ground in large quantities. Can be seen at Cubbon Park,\\nLalbagh and in other parts of the city.\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Grow Type\": \"Deciduos\", \"Fruits Info\": \"Pointed at both ends\", \"Language Common\": \"Fountain Tree, Squirt Tree, Scarlet Bell Tree\", \"Name\": \"African Tulip Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"imparipinnate\", \"Bark Texture\": \"Smooth\", \"Fruits Shape\": \"Woody pod\", \"Fruits Size\": \"25 cm\", \"Fruits Color\": \"Green\", \"Introduced\": \"End of 19 century\", \"Flowers Color\": \"orange-scarlet\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spathodea\", \"Bark Color\": \"Pale greyish brown\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/African%20Tulip%20Tree.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?35209\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-318309\"], \"Family\": \"Bignoniaceae\", \"Leaves Info\": \"Flurry when young later smooth and glossy\", \"Authority\": \"P.Beauv.\", \"Height\": \"7-25 m\", \"Leaflet Terminal\": \"Odd\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Aug-Dec\", \"Leaves Shape\": \"Oval\", \"Images\": [\"African Tulip Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"0016\", \"0017\", \"0018\", \"0019\", \"0020\", \"0021\", \"0022\", \"0023\", \"0024\", \"0025\", \"0026\", \"0027\", \"Bark\", \"Canopy Leafless\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud 1\", \"Flower Bud 2\", \"Flower Bunch\", \"Flower Single\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Falling\", \"Fruit New\", \"Fruit Seed\", \"Fruit Tender\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf New\", \"Leaf Tender\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Flowers Shape\": \"Cup\", \"Native\": \"Equatorial Africa\", \"Flowers Info\": \"Dense terminal clusters, Upper rim lined with yellow\", \"Species\": \"Campanulata\", \"Flowers Size\": \"Large\", \"Size\": \"Medium\"}"
