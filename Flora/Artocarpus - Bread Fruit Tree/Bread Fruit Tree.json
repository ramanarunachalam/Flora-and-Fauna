Breadfruit trees grow to a                  height of 20 m. The large and thick leaves are deeply cut into pinnate lobes. All parts of the tree yield latex, a milky                  juice. The trees are monoecious, with male and female flowers growing on the same tree. The male flowers emerge first,                  followed shortly afterwards by the female flowers, growing into a capitulum. These can be pollinated three days later.                  The pollinators are fruit bats. The compound, false fruit develops from the swollen perianth and originates from                  1,500-2,000 flowers. These are visible on the skin of the fruit as hexagon-like disks. When fully ripe the fruit is                  cream colored and fragrant on the inside. The mature fruits are high in carbohydrates and low in fat and protein. They                  are also a good source of B vitamins.\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Grow Type\": \"Evergreen\", \"Language Hindi\": \"bakri-chajhar\", \"Name\": \"Bread Fruit Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"Palmately Lobed\", \"Fruits Color\": \"Green\", \"Genus\": \"Artocarpus\", \"Flowers Color\": \"White\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadfruit\", \"Bark Color\": \"Grey\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Breadfruit.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?4319\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2653919\"], \"Family\": \"Moraceae\", \"Authority\": \"(Parkinson) Fosberg\", \"Height\": \"26 m\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Feb-Mar\", \"Bark Texture\": \"not rough\", \"Images\": [\"Bread Fruit Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"0016\", \"0017\", \"0018\", \"0019\", \"Bark\", \"Branch\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower Falling\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Falling\", \"Fruit New 1\", \"Fruit New 2\", \"Fruit Ripe\", \"Fruit Tender 1\", \"Fruit Tender 2\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf New\", \"Leaf Tender\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Native\": \"S.
