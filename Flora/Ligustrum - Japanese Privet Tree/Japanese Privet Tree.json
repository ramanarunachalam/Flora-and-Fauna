The leaves are 5\u201310 cm long and 2\u20135 cm broad, glossy dark green above, paler glaucous to yellowish green below, thick and leathery textured, and with an entire margin. The flowers are white, with a four-lobed corolla 5\u20136 mm long; they are borne in clusters 7\u201315 cm long in early summer. The fruit is an oval drupe, 10 mm long, ripening purple-black with a glaucous waxy bloom in early winter; in Japan they are popularly likened to mouse or rat droppings. The species is closely related to the Chinese Ligustrum lucidum, differing in its smaller size (L. lucidum making a tree to over 10 m tall), and elongated oval (not subglobose) fruit.", "Genus": "Ligustrum", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "japonicum", "Native": "Japan, China"}
