Spectacular mid-spring 3 to 4 inch long golden yellow trumpet flowers appear while trees are leafless or just emerging in the spring. Tolerates temperatures into mid 20s F and looks best with occasional to regular watering in warm months though we have noted that plants flower best when not overwatered. In 2007 studies on the genus Tabebuia determined it to be polyphyletic (because as it has stood it includes Crescentia, Spirotecoma, and Ekmanianthe) with the solution being to split some members of the genus, including the two species commonly grown in California, into the new genus Handroanthus. Plants so separated can be distinguished from true Tabebuia based on the fact that they all have minute hairs on the leaves and flowers. Because of this, Tabebuia chrysotricha becomes Handroanthus chrysotrichus, and Tabebuia impetiginosa becomes Handroanthus impetiginosus. The genus name comes from a combination of 'Handro', for a 20th century Brazilian botanist Oswaldo Handro and 'anthos' from Latin for flower.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Name": "Golden Trumpet Tree", "Leaves Type": "palmately Compound", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Color": "green to grey", "Genus": "Handroanthus", "Flowers Color": "Yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handroanthus_chrysotrichus", "Bark Color": "grey or darly silver", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Golden-Haired%20Trumpet%20Tree.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?454769", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-317139"], "Family": "Bignoniaceae", "Authority": "(Mart. ex DC.)
