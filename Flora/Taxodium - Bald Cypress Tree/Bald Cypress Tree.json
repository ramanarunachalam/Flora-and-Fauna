The bark is gray-brown to red-brown, shallowly vertically fissured, with a stringy texture. The leaves are born on deciduous branchlets that are spirally arranged on the stem, but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, 1\\u20132 cm long and 1\\u20132 mm broad; unlike most other species in the family Cupressaceae, it is deciduous, losing its leaves in the winter months, hence the name 'bald'. It is monoecious. Male and female strobili mature in about 12 months; they are produced from buds formed in the late fall, with pollination in early winter. The seed cones are green maturing gray-brown, globular, and 2-3.5 cm in diameter. They have from 20 to 30 spirally arranged, four-sided scales, each bearing one or two (rarely three) triangular seeds. The number of seeds per cone ranges from 20 to 40. The cones disintegrate when mature to release the large seeds. The seeds are 5\\u201310 mm long, the largest of any species in the cypress family, and are produced every year, but with heavy crops every three to five years. The seedlings have three to 9 (most often six) cotyledons.\", \"Genus\": \"Taxodium\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Species\": \"distichum\", \"Native\": \"America\"}"
