"{\"Common Family\": \"Verbena\", \"Where\": [\"Near Lake View Ganesha, Ulsoor Lake, Ulsoor, Bangalore\"], \"Leaves Size\": \"4-20 cm\", \"Description\": \"Native to tropical America, Fiddlewood is a beautiful shrub or a small tree with long tassels of richly scented white flowers. Flowers are pendant and cover the tree from spring to fall. Foliage is dark green, shiny, ornamental. Normally seen as a shrub, Fiddlewood can grow to about 40 feet tall in its native habitat. Fiddlewood makes a nice patio tree planted in the shade of pines or other tall trees. Young plants can be upright and rounded; older specimens develop a rounded vase form with lower branches removed. Fiddlewood is tolerant of sandy, dry soil and adapts to a wide range of soil pH including alkaline. Moderate salt tolerance allows planting near the beach. The tiny flowers are a favourite to the bees. The wood of this tree is said to be useful for making musical instruments - that could be the reason for its common name, fiddlewood.\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Grow Type\": \"Evergreen\", \"Language Common\": \"Fiddlewood\", \"Name\": \"Spiny Fiddlewood Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"oval\", \"Fruits Color\": \"red or black\", \"Genus\": \"Citharexylum\", \"Flowers Color\": \"White\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citharexylum_spinosum\", \"Bark Color\": \"brown\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Fiddlewood.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?10664\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-41323\"], \"Family\": \"Verbenaceae\", \"Flowers Size\": \"7-10 mm\", \"Authority\": \"L.\", \"Height\": \"40 ft\", \"Flowers Season\": \"May-Aug\", \"Images\": [\"Spiny Fiddlewood Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"0016\", \"0017\", \"0018\", \"0019\", \"0020\", \"0021\", \"0022\", \"0023\", \"Bark\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower Bunch\", \"Flower Single\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit New\", \"Fruit Tender 1\", \"Fruit Tender 2\", \"Fruit Tender 3\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf Falling\", \"Leaf\", \"Spine\"]], \"Native\": \"Tropical America\", \"Flowers Info\": \"racemes 20-40 cm\", \"Species\": \"Spinosum\", \"Size\": \"Medium\"}"
