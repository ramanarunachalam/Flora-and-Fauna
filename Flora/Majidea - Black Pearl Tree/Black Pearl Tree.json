This very ornamental small tree has shiny foliage with an attractive rounded canopy, making it very suitable for small tropical gardens or a container plant in cooler climates. They are hardy only in frost-free zones, otherwise they can make a rare and unique houseplant as they are smaller when container grown. The leaves are compound with up to 10 pairs of leaflets, which are elliptic about 5\\u20137 centimetres (2.0\\u20132.8 in) long and 2\\u20133 cm (0.79\\u20131.2 in) wide.
