This very ornamental small tree has shiny foliage with an attractive rounded canopy, making it very suitable for small tropical gardens or a container plant in cooler climates. They are hardy only in frost-free zones, otherwise they can make a rare and unique houseplant as they are smaller when container grown. The leaves are compound with up to 10 pairs of leaflets, which are elliptic about 5\u20137 centimetres (2.0\u20132.8 in) long and 2\u20133 cm (0.79\u20131.2 in) wide. Its highly ornamental seeds mean it's sometimes referred to as the black pearl tree or velvet-seed tree. It flowers with dense custers of small green-red, fragrant flowers at the end of panicles. Fruit is spherical with 3 lobes, 3 cm (1.2 in) long. The fruit splits open, showing the bright red interior, with 3 spherical, velvety blue-black seeds.
