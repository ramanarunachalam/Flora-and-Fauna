The seed is poisonous. The potent poison in the seeds is removed by soaking the seeds in water. Water from the first seed-soaking will kill birds, goats, sheep and hogs. Water from the following soakings is said to be harmless.  After the final soaking, the seeds are dried and ground into flour. The flour is used to make highly acclaimed tortillas, tamales, soup and porridge. It is highly medicinal in value.", "Genus": "Cycas", "Type": "Shrub", "Species": "circinalis", "Native": ["Sri Lanka"]}
