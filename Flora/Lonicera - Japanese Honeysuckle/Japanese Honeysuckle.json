It is a twining vine able to climb up to 10 m high or more in trees, with opposite, simple oval leaves 3-8 cm long and 2-3 cm broad. The flowers are attractive and very fragrant, but the vine is extremely invasive. The flowers, which turn from white to yellow as they age, first appear in early May and continue intermittently through fall. They are popular nectar sources for bees, butterflies and humans. The Manipuri name Madhumati is indicative of that. The fruit is a globose dark blue berry 5-8 mm diameter containing numerous seeds."]}, {"N": 20, "V": [0, "", ["Eastern Asia"]]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 4]}]}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 10]}, {"N": 11, "V": [0, "", "Fragrant"]}], "CI": "Lonicera - Japanese Honeysuckle/Japanese Honeysuckle - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 23, "V": [0, "", "berry like"]}, {"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 1]}]}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 32, "V": [1, 4, 11]}], "CI": "Lonicera - Japanese Honeysuckle/Japanese Honeysuckle - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [], "mapregion": []}
