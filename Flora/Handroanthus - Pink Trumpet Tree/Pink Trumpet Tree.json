{"Leaves Texture": "Feathery", "Common Family": "Jacaranda", "Type": "Tree", "Leaflet Numbers": "5", "Description": "The Pink Lapacho is a rather large deciduous tree, with trunks sometimes reaching 8 dm width and 30 m height. Usually a third of that height is trunk, and two thirds are its longer branches. It has a large, globous, but often sparse canopy. The tree has a slow growth rate. Leaves are opposite and petiolate, 2 to 3 inches long, elliptic and lanceolate, with lightly serrated margins and pinnate venation. The leaves are palmately compound with usually 5 leaflets. Its bark is brownish grey, tough and hard to peel. The wood is of a pleasant yellowish colour, barely knotted and very tough and heavy (0,935 kg/dm\u00b3). It's rich in tannins and therefore very resistant to weather and sun[. It is not very useful for furniture since it is so hard to work by hand. It can be found as beams or fulfilling other structural uses where needed outdoors.", "Where": ["inner ring road, domlur, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Name": "Pink Trumpet Tree", "Leaves Type": "palmately Compound", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Size": "35 cm", "Fruits Color": "green to dark grey", "Genus": "Handroanthus", "Flowers Color": "deep pink", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabebuia_impetiginosa", "Bark Color": "grey or darly silver", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Pink%20Trumpet%20Tree.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?454772", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-317146"], "Family": "Bignoniaceae", "Authority": "(Mart. ex DC.)
