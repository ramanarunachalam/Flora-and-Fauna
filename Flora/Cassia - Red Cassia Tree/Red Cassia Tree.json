The tree has alternate pinnate leaves in pairs with colored margins which further enhance the appearance. The leaves are about 1 ft long and each has 15-20 pairs of oblong 2 in leaflets. Red cassia produces clusters of pink, rose or orange flowers in axillary and terminal, often branched, racemes. Sepal cup is hairy, with sepals ovate, 4-7 mm long. Petals are 1-1.5 cm long, oblong-obovate, hairy externally. Stamens are 10, 4 long, 3 medium sized and 3 small, not swollen in the middle. The fruit is a typical legume: it is cylindrical and indehiscent (does not split open by itself), 8-12 in long, less than 1 in in diameter, and bears many seeds separated by papery partitions.", "Where": ["12th Main Road, Indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Name": "Red Cassia Tree", "Leaves Type": "paripinnate", "Fruits Shape": "Cylinderical pod", "Fruits Size": "25 cm", "Genus": "Cassia", "Flowers Color": "Red", "Wiki": "http://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pink_SHower_Tree", "Bark Color": "dark brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Red%20Cassia.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?100030", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-1108"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Ceylon senna", "Roxburghis cassia"]}, "Leaves Info": "Velvety leaflets, unequal at base, notched or blunt, with a minute point at apex.", "Authority": "DC.", "Flowers Season": "May-Jul", "Bark Texture": "fissured", "Images": ["Red Cassia Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Bunch", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["S.
