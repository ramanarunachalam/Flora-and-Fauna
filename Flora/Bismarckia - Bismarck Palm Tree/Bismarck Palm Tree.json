"{\"Common Family\": \"Palm\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Fruits Shape\": \"oblong\", \"Description\": \"Bismarck Palm is a massive tropical palm with a stout trunk and a symmetric huge crown. It grows a single trunk that is smooth on mature specimens but young individuals retain old leaf bases. This palm may reach an ultimate height of 50-60 ft with a spread of 20 ft or more. Even young specimens that have yet to form a trunk sport full crowns of about 25 leaves with the maximum spread. Leave are palmately lobe, bright light blue, waxy and are up to 10 ft across. They are supported on 6 ft stems that can be 10 inches in diameter. The leaf bases split where they attach to the trunk (like those of Sabal palmetto) and the leaf stems are armed with small sharp teeth. Bismarck Palm is native to Madagascar.\", \"Where\": [\"Lalbagh, Bangalore\"], \"Grow Type\": \"Evergreen\", \"Trunk\": \"30-45cm diameter\", \"Name\": \"Bismarck Palm Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"fan\", \"Fruits Size\": \"2.5-3.5cm\", \"Fruits Color\": \"unknown\", \"Genus\": \"Bismarckia\", \"Flowers Color\": \"Cream\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarckia_nobilis\", \"Bark Color\": \"brown\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Bismarck%20Palm.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?7247\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-22257\"], \"Family\": \"Arecaceae\", \"Authority\": \"Hildebrandt & H.Wendl.\", \"Height\": \"25m\", \"Images\": [\"Bismarck Palm Tree\", [\"0000\", \"Bark\", \"Branch\", \"Canopy\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Native\": \"Madagascar\", \"Species\": \"nobilis\", \"Size\": \"Medium\"}"
