It is native to the northern coast of South America. This plant, on account of its large tubular scarlet flowers, is one of the most beautiful of the West Indian trees. This dense, rounded, evergreen native tree grows slowly to a height of 25 feet with an equal spread and can develop a trunk 12 inches thick. The large, seven-inch-long, stiff, dark green leaves are rough and hairy, feeling much like sandpaper. Appearing throughout the year, but especially in spring and summer, are dark orange, two-inch-wide flowers which appear in clusters at branch tips. The splendid flowers are followed by one to two-inch-long, pear-shaped fruits, which have a pleasant fragrance but are not particularly tasty.\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Grow Type\": \"Deciduous\", \"Language Common\": \"Scarlet Cordia, Orange Geiger Tree, Sebesten plum, Geiger Tree\", \"Name\": \"Scarlet Cordia Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"ovate\", \"Fruits Color\": \"Green\", \"Genus\": \"Cordia\", \"Flowers Color\": \"scarlet\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordia_sebestena\", \"Bark Color\": \"grey\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Scarlet%20Cordia.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?11494\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2737208\"], \"Family\": \"Boraginaceae\", \"Authority\": \"L.\", \"Height\": \"15 m\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Mar-May\", \"Images\": [\"Scarlet Cordia Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"0016\", \"0017\", \"0018\", \"0019\", \"0020\", \"0021\", \"0022\", \"0023\", \"0024\", \"0025\", \"Bark\", \"Branch\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Tender\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf New\", \"Leaf Tender\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Native\": \"E.
