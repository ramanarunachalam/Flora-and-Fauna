The trunk is fluted at the base but not buttressed; it is greyish and rough, and becomes shallowly fissured and flaky with age.  Flowers are white and grow in compact clusters at the end of twigs or in leaf-axils. They have a strong fregrance. Fruits are oblong and green when ripe, and have leathery flesh.
