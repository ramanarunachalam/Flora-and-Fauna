{"Common Family": "pea", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Description": "A medium to large, spreading tree, growing up to 20 metres, but more commonly from 5 to 10 metres depending on conditions. Canopy spread can vary between 5 to 15 metres. Trees grown in poor soil or in very dry conditions tend to be smaller (about 5 metres tall with a 5 metre canopy spread) and more sparsely foliaged. Trunk form varies from specimens with single trunks to low-branching specimens with multiple trunks. Leaves are compound, composed of four to eight pairs of leaflets, each with an entire, wavy margin attached to a stem. Bark is smooth and varies from grey to light brown from tree to tree. Flowers are numerous, a deep red, and filled with nectar. Flowers generally appear in Spring, although exact flowering times vary from tree to tree. The fruit is a hard, woody pod about 15 cm long that splits on the tree releasing the seeds, each attached by a fleshy, yellow aril.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Name": "Weeping Boerbean Tree", "Leaves Type": "paripinnate", "Fruits Color": "brown", "Genus": "Schotia", "Flowers Color": "scarlet", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schotia_brachypetala", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Weeping%20Boer-Bean.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?33301", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-1695"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Weeping boerbean", "Huilboerboon", "Tree fuchsia", "African walnut"]}, "Authority": "Sond.", "Flowers Season": "Jan-Feb, Oct-Nov", "Images": ["Weeping Boerbean Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "0024", "0025", "0026", "0027", "0028", "0029", "Bark Young", "Bark", "Branch", "Canopy Leaf", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit Falling", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["Africa"], "Species": "brachypetala", "Size": "Small"}
