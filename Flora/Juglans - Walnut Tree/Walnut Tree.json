It is a light-demanding species, requiring full sun to grow well.  The bark is smooth, olive-brown when young and silvery-grey on older branches, and features scattered broad fissures with a rougher texture. Like all walnuts, the pith of the twigs contains air spaces; this chambered pith is brownish in color. The leaves are alternately arranged, 25\\u201340 cm long, odd-pinnate with 5\\u20139 leaflets, paired alternately with one terminal leaflet. The largest leaflets are the three at the apex, 10\\u201318 cm long and 6\\u20138 cm broad; the basal pair of leaflets are much smaller, 5\\u20138 cm long, with the margins of the leaflets entire. The male flowers are in drooping catkins 5\\u201310 cm long, and the female flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five, ripening in the autumn into a fruit with a green, semifleshy husk and a brown, corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk, falls in autumn; the seed is large, with a relatively thin shell, and edible, with a rich flavour.\", \"Genus\": \"Juglans\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Species\": \"regia\", \"Native\": \"India, Europe\"}"
