Other less commonly used names include Colonial Pine, Richmond River Pine, Queensland Pine, Alloa, Ningwik, or Pien, the wood is sometimes called Arakaria). The scientific name honours the botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham, who collected the first specimens in the 1820s. The species is found in the coastal rainforests of eastern Australia and in New Guinea. The trees can live up to 450 years and grow to a height of 60 metres. The bark is rough and splits naturally but does not peel. The leaves on young trees are awl-shaped, 1-2 cm long, about 2 mm thick at the base, and scale-like, incurved, 1-2 cm long and 4 mm broad on mature trees. The cones are ovoid, 8-10 cm long and 6-8 cm diameter, and take about 18 months to mature. They disintegrate at maturity to release the nut-like edible seeds.", "Language Common": "Moreton Bay Pine, Hoop Pine", "Genus": "Araucaria", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "cunninghamii", "Native": "New Guinea, Australia"}
