The bark is rough and splits naturally but does not peel. The leaves on young trees are awl-shaped, 1-2 cm long, about 2 mm thick at the base, and scale-like, incurved, 1-2 cm long and 4 mm broad on mature trees. The cones are ovoid, 8-10 cm long and 6-8 cm diameter, and take about 18 months to mature. They disintegrate at maturity to release the nut-like edible seeds.", "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "Hoop Pine Tree", "Leaves Type": "needle", "Genus": "Araucaria", "Where": ["Cubbon Park, Bangalore"], "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria_cunninghamii", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?3837", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-14352"], "Family": "Araucariaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Moreton bay pine", "Hoop pine"]}, "Authority": "Aiton ex A.
