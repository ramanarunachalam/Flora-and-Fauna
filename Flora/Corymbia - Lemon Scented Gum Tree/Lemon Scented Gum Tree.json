{"Common Family": "Eucalyptus", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "oval", "Description": "Lemon Scented Gum is a very fast growing tree, up to 51 metres in height, from temperate and tropical north eastern Australia. It has smooth, pale, uniform or slightly mottled bark, white to coppery in summer, and a conspicuously narrow-leaved crown which smells strongly of lemons. Pear-shaped buds are borne in clusters of three, formed in the corner of leaf and stem junctions, whilst fruit (capsules) are urn-shaped. The bark is smooth for the entire height of the tree, often powdery, shedding in thin curling flakes.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "Lemon Scented Gum Tree", "Leaves Type": "lance", "Fruits Color": "green to grey", "Genus": "Corymbia", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corymbia_citriodora", "Bark Color": "white", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Lemon%20Scented%20Gum.html%22", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?404658", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-47992"], "Family": "Myrtaceae", "Authority": "(Hook.)
