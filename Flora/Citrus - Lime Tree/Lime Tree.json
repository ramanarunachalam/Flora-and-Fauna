Lime is a shrubby tree, to 5 m, with many thorns. Dwarf varieties are popular with home growers. The trunk rarely grows straight, with many branches that often originate quite far down on the trunk. The leaves are ovate 1-3.5 in long, resembling orange leaves (the scientific name aurantiifolia refers to this resemblance to the leaves of the orange, C. aurantium). The flowers are 1 in in diameter, are yellowish white with a light purple tinge on the margins. Flowers and fruit appear throughout the year but are most abundant from May to September. Lime have an odour similar to lemon, but more fresh. The juice is as sour as lemon juice, but more aromatic. The english name lime originated from Arabic limun and Persian limou.", "Genus": "Citrus", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "aurantifolia", "Size": "Small"}
