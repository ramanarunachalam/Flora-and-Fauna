Stems may reach up to 30 cm (12 in) diameter on old plants; in forest habitats they may become horizontal with erect side branches. Young plants have a single unbranched stem with a rosette of leaves until the growing tip flowers or is damaged, after which it branches, producing two or more new stems; thereafter, branching increases with subsequent flowering episodes.The leaves are glossy green, lanceolate, 20-150 cm (7.9-59 in) long and 2-12 cm (0.79-4.7 in) wide; small leaves are erect to spreading, and larger leaves usually drooping under their weight. The flowers are produced in panicles 15-160 cm (5.9-63 in) long, the individual flowers are 2.5 cm (0.98 in) diameter, with a six-lobed corolla, pink at first, opening white with a fine red or purple central line on each of the 7-12 mm (0.28-0.47 in) lobes; they are highly fragrant, and popular with pollinating insects.
