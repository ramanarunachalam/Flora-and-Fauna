It has simple, ovate leaves, opposite or arranged in whorls of three,with green petioles and smooth leaf margins. The leaves are often folded up from the midrib. When the leaves are crushed they produce a very strong smell which can be offensive or displeasing. Typical of this species are the branchlets covered with small raised pale dots (lenticels). The flowers are bell-shaped with five mauve to pink flowers and four stamens, pinker than the petals, with yellow anthers. Flowers are arranged in rounded heads and are produced inland from November to April, and all year round along the coast. The round fruits (berries) are crowded at the tip of the branches.. The berries are green before maturity, and become pale yellow when ripe.", "Genus": "Volkameria", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "glabrum", "Native": ["S. Africa"]}
