Native to the                        tropical regions of Asia, Java Cassia is distributed naturally from India to Malaysia, Sumatra, Indonesia, southern                       China, and the Phillipines. Java cassia is a fast-growing, semideciduous tree up to 25 m in height and 35 cm d.b.h.                  The species blooms best in places with well-drained and deep soils. The trunk frequently has many shoots. The crown,                      consisting of descending branch- es with sparse foliage, is wide-open, arched, and spread out. The leaves are                             paripinnate, made up of 12 pairs of leaflets that are elliptic or oblong and rounded at the apex and base. The flowers                    are pale rose to crimson and arranged in racemes.
