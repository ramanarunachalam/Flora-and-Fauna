{"Common Family": "Knotweed", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "olive like", "Description": "Sea Grape is a sprawling bush or small tree that is found near sea beaches throughout tropical America. It reaches a maximum height of 8 m, but usually just a little more than 2 m tall. It has large, round, leathery leaves, up to 25 cm across, with a red primary vein. The fragrant white flowers are very small and borne on 6-10 in spikes. The bark is smooth and yellowish. In late summer female trees bear purplish fruit, about 2 cm in diameter, in large grape-like clusters. The fruit is fleshy with a hard stone. The fruits are edible raw and are made into \"seaside jelly\" or wine. In the West Indies, they boil the wood to yield a red dye. Wood from larger trees is prized for cabinet work.", "Where": ["Near Glass House, Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "Sea Grape Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "green", "Genus": "Coccoloba", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccoloba_uvifera", "Bark Color": "grey", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Sea%20Grape.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?10993", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2729556"], "Family": "Polygonaceae", "Authority": "(L.)
