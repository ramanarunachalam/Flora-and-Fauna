It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds 8\u201315 metres (26\u201349 ft) in height. The silvery green leaves are oblong in shape, measuring 4\u201310 centimetres (1.6\u20133.9 in) long and 1\u20133 centimetres (0.39\u20131.2 in) wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.  The small white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves.  The fruit is a small drupe 1\u20132.5 centimetres (0.39\u20130.98 in) long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage. Canned black olives may contain chemicals (usually ferrous sulfate) that turn them black artificially.", "Genus": "Olea", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "europaea", "Native": ["S. E. Europe", "W.
