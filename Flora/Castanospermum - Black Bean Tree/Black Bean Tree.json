Leaves are 15 X 6-7 cm , pinnate,                   with 11-15 leaflets. The flowers are red and yellow,                                     3-4 cm long, borne in racemes 6 cm long. The fruit is a cylindrical pod                   12-20 cm long and 4-6 cm diameter. The fruit is divided                   into 3-5 cells, each of which contains a large chestnut-like seed.\nThis is a handsome tree with glossy dark green leaves and low spreading\nbranches when grown in the open. It bears sprays of red and yellow pea-shaped flowers\n(about 3 to 4 cm long), which are partly hidden by the dense foliage. The nectar produced\nby the flowers attracts birds, bats and butterflies in its native land. Large woody pods\n(measuring 12-20cm by 4-6 cm) are produced following flowering. The pods look like large\ngroundnuts. These pods split in two, revealing 2-4 large bean-like seeds.\nIt is an ideal shade tree in parks, resorts and gardens. It is known to have a strong root\nsystem, which can be used to consolidate stream banks against erosion.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Faboideae", "Fruits Info": "A fat glossy pod", "Name": "Black Bean Tree", "Fruits Texture": "Glossy", "Leaves Type": "imparipinnate", "Medicines": "The tree is known to contain alkaloids that have been shown to have anti-HIV and anti-cancer properties.", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Size": "20 cm", "Fruits Color": "green to brown", "Genus": "Castanospermum", "Flowers Color": "Red", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castanospermum", "Bark Color": "Grey or brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Australian%20Chestnut.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?9525", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-7146"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Australian chestnut", "Moreton bay chestnut"]}, "Leaves Info": "Dark, glossy with rounded base and pointed apex", "Authority": "A.Cunn & C.Fraser ex Hook.", "Height": "35 m", "Leaflet Terminal": "Odd", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Mar, Nov-Dec", "Bark Texture": "rough", "Images": ["Black Bean Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit Seed", "Fruit Tender 1", "Fruit Tender 2", "Fruit", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["Australia"], "Flowers Info": "Yellow turning Red", "Species": "Australe", "Size": "Large"}
