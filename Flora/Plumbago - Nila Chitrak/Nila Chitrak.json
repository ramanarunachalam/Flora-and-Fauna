Plumbago can be pruned to grow like a vine and scramble over supports, or pruned into a more compact mounded shrub, or left to sprawl with its long, gracefully arching branches. The 2 in oblong leaves are a fresh, light yellowish green color. The sky blue flowers are 1 in long tubes expanding into 5 petals spreading about 1 in across. The flowers are borne in rounded terminal clusters 6 in across and look quite a bit like phlox flowers. Plumbago blooms all year long except for the coldest winter months.", "Language Common": "Plumbago, Cape Leadwort", "Genus": "Plumbago", "Type": "Shrub", "Species": "auriculata", "Native": "Asia"}
