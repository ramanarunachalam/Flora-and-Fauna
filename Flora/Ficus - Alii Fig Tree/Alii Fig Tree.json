It is an evergreen often grown as a houseplant in temperate climates. The leaves are 8-13 cm and uniquely dimorphic; with narrow leaves on the lower, sterile branches and broader leaves on the higher branches. The most common cultivar is 'Alii' which was originally introduced in Hawaii. In the past this cultivar was often misidentified as F. binnendijkii or under the spurious name Ficus longifolia.
