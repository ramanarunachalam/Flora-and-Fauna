This species grows on the banks of freshwater rivers, the edges of freshwater swamps and lagoons and on seasonally flooded lowland plains, commonly on heavy soils. Found in Madagascar and tropical Asia, amongst other places. Propagation is by seed. Tolerant of heavy clay soils with poor drainage, it can grow in a range of soils.\", \"Genus\": \"Barringtonia\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Species\": \"acutangula\", \"Native\": \"S.
