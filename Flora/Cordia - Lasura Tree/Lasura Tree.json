{"Common Family": "Forget-me-not", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "olive like", "Description": "Lasura is a fairly fast growing species. It matures in about 50 to 60 years by when its girth at the breast height is about 1 to 1.5 m. Its bole (main trunk) is generally straight and cylindrical, attaining a height of nearly 3 to 4 m. The branches spread in all directions by virtue of which its crown can be trained into a beautiful inverted dome like an umbrella. When fully grown up, the total height of the tree comes to nearly 10 to 15 m. In less favorable climate and or unfavorable environment, however, it has a lesser growth and may attain a somewhat crooked form. In still worse environment it can even remain stunted like a shrub.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduos", "Name": "Lasura Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "green turning red", "Genus": "Cordia", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordia_myxa", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?11489", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2737033"], "Family": "Boraginaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Lasura", "Assyrian plum", "Pidar", "Panugeri", "Naruvilli", "Geduri", "Spistan", "Burgund dulu wanan"]}, "Authority": "L.", "Flowers Season": "Mar-Apr", "Images": ["Lasura Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["China"], "Species": "myxa", "Size": "Medium"}
