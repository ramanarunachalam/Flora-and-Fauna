Leaves are heart-shaped, 4-8 inches long, 2-4 inches wide. It is cultivated for its beautiful pendulous deep pink flower-balls. The name is in honor of Joseph Dombay, a French medical man and botanist who made extensive plant collections in Peru and Chile. D. wallichii is a broad-headed tree growing up to 30 feet. It has heart shaped toothed leaves up to 12 inches long with pointed tips. Leaves have fine hairs on the underside. The blooms of this plant have a pleasant fragrance, almost like caramel corn.
