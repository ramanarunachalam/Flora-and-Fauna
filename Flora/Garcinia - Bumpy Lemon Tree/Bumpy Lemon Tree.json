The interior is soft white pulp and has a slight citrus taste people have compared to a sweet santol fruit or lemony cotton candy. The species was formerly included in the genus Rheedia, which has since been absorbed into Garcinia, as Rheedias species are now known as \"new world mangosteens\". The fruit is not very well known outside of South America and a few backyard growers in South Florida. It is closely related to other edible tropical fruits such as purple mangosteen and button mangosteen.", "Genus": "Garcinia", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "madruno", "Native": "Centrl and South America"}
