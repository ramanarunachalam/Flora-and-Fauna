Leaves are double-compound, alternately arranged, 20-45 cm long, 10-20 cm broad, with 8-16 pairs of up to 20 cm long side-stalks. Side-stalks are prickles at the base and with 10-20 pairs of oblong, 10-20 mm x 6-10 mm long leaflets, very oblique at base, rounded to notched at the tip. Yellow flowers are borne panicles in leaf axils and at the end of branches. Flowers fragrant, 2-3 cm long, 5-merous. Stamens are waxy-white, filaments densely woolly at the base. Fruits are woody pods, compressed with a hard recurved short beak, with 3-4 seeds. The heartwood which is used in medicine is light yellow when freshly cut, but it quickly changes to red. The color diffuses out easily in hot water. In about 7-10 hours the extract becomes deep orange in color. Sappan-wood was a major trade good during the 17th century, when it was exported from Southeast Asian nations aboard red seal ships to Japan.", "Where": ["2nd Cross Road, 13th main road, indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Name": "Sappan Wood Tree", "Leaves Type": "bipinnate", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Color": "Green", "Genus": "Caesalpinia", "Flowers Color": "yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesalpinia_sappan", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Sappan%20Wood.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?8309", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-956"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Flowers Season": "Jul-Oct", "Leaves Shape": "oval", "Images": ["Sappan Wood Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf", "Spine"]], "Native": ["India"], "Species": "sappan", "Size": "Small"}
