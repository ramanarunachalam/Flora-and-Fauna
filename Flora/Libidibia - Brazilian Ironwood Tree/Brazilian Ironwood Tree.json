The bark of the Brazilian Ironwood is the single most attractive feature of the plant. The pattern formed by the flaking bark inspired the name \"Leopard Tree\". The other captivating feature of the tree is the long, drooping branchlets with feathery leaves. The leaves are double-compound, with broadly oval, rounded leaflets. The flowers are yellow, but unfortunately occur mostly near the top, and hence not easy to observe. They are small, fragrant, yellow, and the standard petal has reddish markings. As the name suggests, the tree is native to Brazil.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduos", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Name": "Brazilian Ironwood Tree", "Leaves Type": "bipinnate", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Color": "green to brown", "Genus": "Libidibia", "Flowers Color": "Bright Yellow", "Wiki": "http://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Libidibia_ferrea", "Bark Color": "brown and Silvery", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Brazilian%20Ironwood.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?8289", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-32991"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Brazilian ironwood", "Iron wood", "Leopard tree"]}, "Authority": "(Mart. ex Tul.)
