The leaves are ovate, 5\u20139 cm (2.0\u20133.5 in) long and 4\u20138 cm (1.6\u20133.1 in) wide, with a rounded base, a pointed tip and a finely serrated margin. The flowers are 2\u20134.5 cm (0.8\u20131.8 in) in diameter, with five white to pinkish petals; they are produced singly or in pairs in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is a drupe similar to a small peach, 1.5\u20132.5 cm (0.6\u20131.0 in) diameter (larger in some modern cultivars), from yellow to orange, often tinged red on the side most exposed to the sun; its surface can be smooth (botanically described as: glabrous) or velvety with very short hairs (botanically: pubescent). The flesh is usually firm and not very juicy. Its taste can range from sweet to tart. The single seed is enclosed in a hard, stony shell, often called a \"stone\", with a grainy, smooth texture except for three ridges running down one side.", "Genus": "Prunus", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "armeniaca", "Native": ["China", "India", "Europe"]}
