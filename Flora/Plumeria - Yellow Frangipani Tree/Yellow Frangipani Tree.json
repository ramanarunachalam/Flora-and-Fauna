Frangipani, also known as the Plumeria, is native to warm tropical areas of the Pacific Islands, Caribbean, South America and Mexico. They can grow to be large shrubs or even small trees in mild areas of the U.S. In tropical regions, Plumeria may reach a height of 30' to 40' and half as wide. Their widely spaced thick succulent branches are round or pointed, and have long leather, fleshy leaves in clusters near the branch tips. Leaves tend to fall in early winter since they are deciduous and sensitive to cold. Plumeraia rubra acutifolia has very fragrant white flowers with yellow centers. The petals are small and strongly overlapping, giving the impression of a flower in the process of unfolding.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Fruits Info": "shiny two pods with joint end", "Name": "Yellow Frangipani Tree", "Leaves Type": "obovate", "Fruits Color": "deep green to black", "Genus": "Plumeria", "Flowers Color": "yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumeria_rubra", "Bark Color": "Greenish Brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Common%20White%20Frangipani.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?28884", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-161631"], "Family": "Apocynaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Temple tree", "Pagoda tree"]}, "Authority": "L.", "Height": "7-8 m", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Oct", "Images": ["Yellow Frangipani Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "Bark", "Canopy Leafless", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["Central America"], "Flowers Info": "fragrant", "Species": "Rubra", "Size": "Small"}
