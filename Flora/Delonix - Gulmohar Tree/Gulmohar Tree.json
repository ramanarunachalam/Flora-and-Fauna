For several weeks in spring and summer it is covered with exuberant clusters of flame-red flowers, 4-5 in across. Even up close the individual flowers are striking: they have four spoon shaped spreading scarlet or orange-red petals about 3 in long, and one upright slightly larger petal (the standard) which is marked with yellow and white. The delicate, fern-like leaves are composed of small individual leaflets, which fold up at the onset of dusk. Gulmohar gets 30-40 ft tall, but its elegant wide-spreading umbrella-like canopy can be wider than its height. Gumohar is naturalized in India and is widely cultivated as a street tree.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Caesalpinioideae", "Name": "GulMohar Tree", "Leaves Type": "bipinnate", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Size": "60 cm", "Genus": "Delonix", "Flowers Color": "scarlet", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delonix_regia", "Bark Color": "light brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Gulmohar.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?13400", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-1279"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "(Bojer) Raf.", "Flowers Season": "Apr-Jun", "Bark Texture": "not rough", "Images": ["Gulmohar Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Madagascar", "Flowers Info": "5 petals", "Species": "Regia", "Size": "Medium"}
