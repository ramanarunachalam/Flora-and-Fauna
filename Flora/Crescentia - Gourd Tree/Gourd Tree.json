The calabash tree grows to 30 feet often with multiple trunks. The rangy twisting branches have simple elliptical leaves clustered at the nodes. The greenish-yellow flowers are marked with purple veins. The flowers arise from the trunk or main branches and appear from May through January. The woody fruit, botanically a capsule, is elliptic, ovate, or spherical and may grow to 10 inches in diameter. The fruit takes up to seven months to ripen. Fibers from the calabash tree were twisted into twine and ropes. The hard wood made tools and tool handles. The split wood was woven for sturdy baskets. But it was the calabash's gourd-like fruit that made the plant truly useful. Large calabashes were used as bowls and, peculiarly, to disguise the heads of hunters.\", \"Where\": [\"Near Glass House, Lalbagh, Bangalore\"], \"Grow Type\": \"Evergreen\", \"Language Common\": \"Calabash tree\", \"Name\": \"Gourd Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"ovate\", \"Fruits Size\": \"Large\", \"Genus\": \"Crescentia\", \"Flowers Color\": \"greenish yellow and pink\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescentia_cujete\", \"Bark Color\": \"grey\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Calabash%20Tree.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?12209\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-320517\"], \"Family\": \"Bignoniaceae\", \"Flowers Size\": \"6 cm\", \"Authority\": \"L.\", \"Height\": \"5m\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Nov-Dec\", \"Images\": [\"Gourd Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"0016\", \"0017\", \"Bark\", \"Branch\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Flowers Shape\": \"bell\", \"Native\": \"Tropical America\", \"Species\": \"cujete\", \"Size\": \"Small\"}"
