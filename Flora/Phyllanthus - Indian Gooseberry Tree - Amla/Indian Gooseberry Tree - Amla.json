The tree has crooked trunk and spreading branches. The leaves are simple, nearly stalkless and closely                     set along slender branchlets. The leaves are often mistaken for leaflets of pinnate leaves. The genus name Phyllanthus                    is derived from Greek words meaning leaf-flower, an allusion to the apparent bearing of flowers on the leaves. Amla                       flowers are small, greenish-yellow or pinkish. The flowers have six segments, but no real petals. Male and female                         flowers are carried separately on the same branch. The fruit is nearly spherical, light greenish yellow, quite smooth                     and hard on appearance, with 6 vertical stripes or furrows. Ripening in autumn, the berries are harvested by hand after                   climbing to upper branches bearing the fruits. The taste of Amla is sour, bitter and astringent, and is quite fibrous.                    In India, it is common to eat gooseberries with salt and water to make the sour fruits palatable.\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Grow Type\": \"Deciduos\", \"Fruits Info\": \"Yellow green with translucent skin.\\n6-8 faint lines from base to apex.\", \"Language Kannada\": \"Betta Nelli\", \"Language Telugu\": \"Usirikaya\", \"Language Common\": \"Indian Gooseberry\", \"Language Hindi\": \"Amla\", \"Name\": \"Indian Gooseberry Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"lance\", \"Fruits Shape\": \"Round\", \"Fruits Size\": \"2-4 in diameter\", \"Fruits Color\": \"Yellow Green\", \"Genus\": \"Phyllanthus\", \"Flowers Color\": \"Pink\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllanthus_emblica\", \"Bark Color\": \"Grey\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Amla.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?28119\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-153790\"], \"Family\": \"Phyllanthaceae\", \"Language Tamil\": \"Nelli\", \"Leaves Info\": \"Tiny point at apex\", \"Authority\": \"L.\", \"Height\": \"23-80 feet\", \"Leaflet Terminal\": \"Even\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Mar-May\", \"Bark Texture\": \"Rough\", \"Images\": [\"Indian Gooseberry Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0012\", \"0013\", \"0014\", \"0015\", \"0016\", \"0017\", \"0018\", \"Bark\", \"Canopy Leaf\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Tender\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf New\", \"Leaf Tender\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Flowers Shape\": \"Cup\", \"Native\": \"India\", \"Flowers Info\": \"6 pink or greenish petal like flower cup segments but no petals.\\nClusters on naked twigs below the leaves.\\nMale and female flowers separate.\", \"Species\": \"Emblica\", \"Flowers Size\": \"Small\", \"Size\": \"Medium\"}"
