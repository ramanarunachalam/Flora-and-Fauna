The flowers, which are arranged in panicles, have a greenish color, and have a distinct odor. The fruit is a purple 1 cm berry containing a single seed. Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity, and it was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and other great potentates.
