Juvenile cohune palms (and some varieties) grow with their trunk underground for many years. The adult tree has a characteristic and massive crown of dark green, pinnate (feather-shaped) leaves extending almost straight up. Each leaf can be up to 33 ft (10 m) long. The leaves crown a solitary trunk that grows 20-50 ft (6.1-15 m) tall and 1-2 ft (0.3-0.6 m) in diameter. The leaflets composing the compound leaves are regularly arranged and spread out in the same plane as the leaf. The leaflets appear to rain down from the leaves, thus earning the common name of rain tree. Cohune palms produce flower clusters up to 5 ft (1.5 m) long, cloistered among the leaves. They may have all male, all female, or both kinds on the same tree. The cream colored flowers yield to brownish yellow fruits, oval-elliptical in shape, 1-3 in (2.5-7.6 cm) long and 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) in diameter. The fruits are carried on long drooping stalks (peduncles) from November through February.", "Genus": "Attalea", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "cohune", "Native": "Mexico, Central America"}
