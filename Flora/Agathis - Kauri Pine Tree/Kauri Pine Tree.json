It grows straight and tall to a height of 30-50 m, with smooth, scaly bark. The leaves are elliptic, 5-12 cm long and 2-5 cm broad, tough and leathery in texture, with no midrib. They are arranged in opposite pairs (rarely whorls of three) on the stem. The seed cones are round, 8-13 cm diameter, and mature in 18-20 months after pollination. They disintegrate at maturity to release the seeds. The male (pollen) cones are cylindrical, 5-10 cm long and 1-1.5 cm thick.", "Genus": "Agathis", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "robusta", "Native": "Australia"}
