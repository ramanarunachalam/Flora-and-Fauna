It also occurs over the widest distribution of all local euphorbias and is also a very variable plant ranging from many-branched shrubs to large trees, depending on the particular habitat. The rubber-hedge euphorbia is a many-branched, succulent plant, usually 3-5 m but may reach 10 m on occasion. The bark of very old specimens is grey and rough with longitudinal dents and ridges that break up into very small fragments. There are sometimes conspicuous, small protuberances, such as a bulge, knob, or swelling, on the bark, and occasionally black, rough, crosswise bands. The branches are cylindrical, smooth and glabrous-green, 5-8 mm in diameter, forming brush-like masses that are the best known feature of this species. Plants are without spines. The leaves are small and slender, up to 12 x 1.5 mm, rarely seen, as they fall very early. Leaf scars on young twigs form conspicuous dents which contract until they are no more than grey dots on older branchlets and can even be seen on fairly thick green stems. The thin twigs are pendant (hanging down), pale green and occur opposite each other, alternate or in groups on the branchlets which gives a rather untidy and rounded appearance to the crowns. The flowers are yellow, inconspicuous, and carried in clusters at the apex of the short branches or in the angles of branches. They appear in September to December.\", \"Genus\": \"Euphorbia\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Species\": \"tirucalli\", \"Native\": \"Africa\"}"
