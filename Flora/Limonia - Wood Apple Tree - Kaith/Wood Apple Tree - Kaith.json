The bark is ridged, fissured and scaly and there are sharp spines 3/4 to 2 in long on some of the zigzag twigs. The deciduous, alternate leaves, 3 to 5 in long, dark-green, leathery, often minutely toothed, blunt or notched at the apex, are dotted with oil glands and slightly lemon-scented when crushed. Yellowish green flowers, tinged with red, 1/2 in across, are borne in small, loose, terminal or lateral panicles. The tree is mostly known for its hard woody fruit, size of a tennis ball, round to oval in shape. The pulp is brown, mealy, odorous, resinous, astringent, acid or sweetish, with numerous small, white seeds scattered through it.", "Where": ["Park behind ESI hospital, indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduous", "Spines Color": "Reddish and shiny", "Spines Shape": "stout straight", "Spines Size": "5 cm", "Name": "Wood Apple Tree", "Fruits Texture": "Smooth", "Leaves Type": "imparipinnate", "Fruits Shape": "round", "Fruits Color": "grey", "Genus": "Limonia", "Flowers Color": "yellowish or green tinged red", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonia_%28plant%29", "Bark Color": "grey", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Wood%20Apple.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?22253", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2493345"], "Family": "Rutaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Kaith tree"]}, "Flowers Size": "12 mm", "Authority": "L.", "Leaflet Terminal": "odd", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Mar", "Images": ["Wood Apple Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower", "Fruit New", "Fruit Tender 1", "Fruit Tender 2", "Fruit Tender 3", "Fruit", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf", "Spine"]], "Native": ["India"], "Flowers Info": "5 petals", "Species": "Acidissima", "Size": "Medium"}
