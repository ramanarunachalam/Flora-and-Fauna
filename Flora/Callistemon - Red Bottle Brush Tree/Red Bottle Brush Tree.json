The                       pollen of the flower forms on the tip of a long coloured stalk called a filament. It is these filaments which give the                    flower spike its colour and distinctive 'bottlebrush' shape. The filaments are usually yellow or red, sometimes the                       pollen also adds a bright yellow flush to the flower spikes. Each flower produces a small woody fruit containing                          hundreds of tiny seeds. These fruits form in clusters along the stem, and are usually held on the plant for many years.                   The seeds are usually not released from the fruits for several years, but in some species the fruits open after about a                   year. Fire also stimulates the opening of the fruits in some bottlebrushes.", "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Fruits Info": "Small wooden cup shaped capsules", "Name": "Red Bottle Brush Tree", "Leaves Type": "Lance", "Bark Texture": "rough", "Fruits Color": "Grey", "Flowers Size": "8 cm", "Flowers Color": "Scarlet", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callistemon_viminalis", "Bark Color": "Dark brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Bottle%20Brush.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?312615", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-31513"], "Family": "Myrtaceae", "Locale": {"Hindi": ["Cheel"]}, "Leaves Info": "Narrow, tapering at poth ends, young leaves softly hairy", "Authority": "(Sol. ex Gaertn.)
