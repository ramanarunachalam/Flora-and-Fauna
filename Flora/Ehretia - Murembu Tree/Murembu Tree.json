Other varieties occur in tropical Africa outside the Region.The wood is described as perishable. It is however used in Za\u00efre (14) and in Kenya (8) to make handles for tools, and in Ethiopia yokes (7). The stems are sometimes used in Ghana as chewsticks (12, 13).Animals are said to browse the foliage in Sudan (2, 3), but in the Makuyuni District the leaves are held to be toxic (9). The leaves are commonly used in the Yoruba agbo infusion given in draught and used as a wash for fever, children\u2019s convulsions, etc. Sap from the fresh leaves is a mild laxative for children (5, 11\u201313). The plant (probably the leaves) is used in Gabon as a laxative and a febrifuge (15). The leaf, usually after pounding with that of Newbouldia laevis (Bignoniaceae) and a guinea pepper, is tied on the head for headache (5).The root, like the leaves, is considered toxic in Makuyuni District of Tanganyika (9, 10) but no application is ascribed to it. A decoction of the roots and leaves is taken in Ghana for infantile tetanus (5, 13), and for dysentery (Field fide 13).In Ivory Coast a bark-decoction is taken for amenorrhoea, and the decoction when left to cool separates to a supernatant layer of oil which is applied to skin-affections (4).The fruit is edible (3, 13) and is used in Ghana as bait for trapping birds (5, 13).A trace of alkaloid has been detected in the plant (? leaves) (1)."]}, {"N": 37, "V": [0, "", ["Africa"]]}]}, {"CN": 7, "CV": []}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 5]}], "CI": "Ehretia - Murembu Tree/Murembu Tree - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 10]}, {"N": 43, "V": [0, "", "Apr"]}], "CI": "Ehretia - Murembu Tree/Murembu Tree - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 45, "V": [0, "", "round"]}, {"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 6]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: green to orange"]}], "CI": "Ehretia - Murembu Tree/Murembu Tree - Fruit.jpg"}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 59, "V": [1, 4, 11]}], "CI": "Ehretia - Murembu Tree/Murembu Tree - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [{"lat": "12.9511724547", "long": "77.5865466539"}], "mapregion": [["12.9511724547", "77.5865466539"], ["12.9511724547", "77.5865466539"]]}
