{"Common Family": "Pine", "Type": "Tree", "Cones Season": "Feb-Mar,Jun-Jul", "Description": "The Cook pine, called Christmas Tree in India, is a tree native to the Cook Island, north-east of Australia in the South Pacific. The bark of the Cook pine peels off in thin paper like sheets. Can reach 60 m in natural habit. But more commonly grown as a house-plant in pots. The relatively short, mostly horizontal branches are in whorls around the slender, upright to slightly leaning trunk. The branches are lined with cord-like, horizontal branchlets. The branchlets are covered with small, green, incurved, point-tipped, spirally arranged, overlapping leaves. The young leaves are needle-like, while the broader adult leaves are triangular and scale-like. The female seed cones are scaly, egg-shaped, and up to 6 inches (15 cm) long. The smaller, more numerous male pollen cones are at the tips of the branchlets and are scaly, foxtail-shaped, and 2 inches (5 cm) long. The bark peels off in papery strips and is rough, gray, and resinous. The trees have a slender, spire-like crown and look like unusually tall, thin Christmas trees.", "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "New Caledonian Pine Tree", "Leaves Type": "needle", "Genus": "Araucaria", "Where": ["Everywhere, Bangalore"], "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria_columnaris", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Christmas%20Tree.html", "http://www.evergreenspecies.com/2009/04/cook-pine-araucaria-columnaris.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?102570", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-14348"], "Family": "Araucariaceae", "Locale": {"Common": ["Christmas tree", "Cook-pine", "New caledonia-pine"]}, "Authority": "(G.
