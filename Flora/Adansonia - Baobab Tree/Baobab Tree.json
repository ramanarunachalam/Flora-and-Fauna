{"Common Family": "baobab", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "oval", "Description": "The Baobab Tree is also known as the tree of life, with good reason too. It is capable of providing shelter, clothing, food, and water for the animal as well as human inhabitants of the African Savannah regions. The cork-like bark or huge stem is fire resistant and is used for making cloth and rope. The leaves are used as condiments and medicines. The fruit, called \"monkey bread\", is rich in vitamin C and is eaten. The tree is capable of storing hundreds of litres of water, which is tapped in dry periods.[source?] Mature trees are frequently hollow, providing living space for numerous animals and humans alike.[source?] Trees are even used as bars, barns, wine and beer shops and more.[source?] Radio-carbon dating has measured that age of some Baobab trees at over 2,000 years old. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduos", "Language Common": "boab, boaboa, bottle tree, the tree of life, upside-down tree, monkey bread tree", "Name": "Baobab Tree", "Leaves Type": "palmately compound", "Genus": "Adansonia", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_digitata", "Bark Color": "red", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?1433", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2621135"], "Family": "Malvaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Height": "5-30m", "Flowers Season": "Jul-Aug", "Images": ["Baobab Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "0024", "0025", "0026", "0027", "Bark", "Branch", "Canopy Leafless", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Falling", "Flower", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Africa", "Species": "digitata", "Size": "Large"}
