The segments extend two-thirds into the blade and have drooping tips. Leaves are dark green above, silvery beneath. Leaft stalks are about 3 ft long. Flowers are borne in sprays 3-4 ft long, with many short yellowish branches bearing white bisexual flowers. Fruit is round, 1.2 cm wide, white when ripe. This is a very slow growing pine.
