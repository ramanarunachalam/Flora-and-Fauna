The compound leaves have two or three 2-3 in oval leaflets and are arranged in pairs opposite each other on the stem. Often, the center leaflet is modified into a coiled, three-parted tendril. Flame vine branches profusely and climbs by clinging with its tendrils. The tubular flowers are about 3 in long and borne in clusters of 15-20 at the tips of branches. The corolla has five lobes which are bent backwards, and the long orange stamens and style extend beyond the tube. The flower clusters may hang down under the weight of their own beauty. Fruits are slender dry capsules about 1 ft long. Flaming trumpet is native to southern Brazil, northern Argentina and Paraguay.\", \"Language Common\": \"Flame vine, Flaming trumpet, Golden shower trumpet, Orange Bignonia\", \"Genus\": \"Pyrostegia\", \"Type\": \"Climber\", \"Species\": \"venusta\", \"Native\": \"Asia\"}"
