It has a straight trunk that is often unbranched, with just one cluster of leaves at the top of the trunk. In big trees, though, there are a few large branches, each with a cluster of leaves at the end. Leaves are large, toothed, long, narrow at the base, and broad at the apex. Flowers, few in number, are large, purple, with many stiff stamens arranged upright in a ring. When they are mature, a few flowers can easily be found on ground beneath adult trees.
