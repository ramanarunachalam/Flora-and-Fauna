The ponytail palm is native to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, and San Luis Potosi in eastern Mexico.[1] The plants have a very noticeable caudex, for the purpose of storing water.  Beaucarnea recurvata, or Ponytail Palm, is native to Mexico. Beacarneas are closely related to Yuccas and thrive under the same conditions. Plants have dark green, grass-like leaves that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide by 6 foot (2 m) long. They have swollen bases for water storage and can store water up to 1 year. Plants in nature will reach about 30 feet (10 m) in height with a base about 12 feet (4 m) across. In containers, they will only reach about 8 foot (2.5 m) in height. They make an excellent houseplant if they are not over-watered.\", \"Genus\": \"Beaucarnea\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Species\": \"recurvata\", \"Fruits Size\": \"1- 1 1/2 inch\", \"Native\": \"Mexico\"}"
