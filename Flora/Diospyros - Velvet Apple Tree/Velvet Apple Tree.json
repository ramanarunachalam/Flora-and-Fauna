Seed trees are normally planted 30 or 45 feet from each other; this one can be planted from 25 to 30 feet from each other. It needs a good distribution of rainfall through the year. Trees that were planted by seeds could take 6 or 7 years to give out fruit, but trees that were propagated by cuttings produce fruit in 3 or 4 years. It is a very productive tree. In Puerto Rico it produces through the months of August and October. In Cebu, Philippines there is a barangay named after the fruit itself. In Bangladesh it is known as 'bilati gab' (=foreign gab), to distinguish it from 'gab' (Diospyros peregrina).  The fact that fruits vary greatly - in shape, color, hairiness and taste - suggests that there is a great deal of genetic variation in the plant. Seedless cultivars exist, and are highly favored since in the normal varieties the large seeds occupy a considerable volume of the fruit."]}, {"N": 20, "V": [0, "", ["Philipines"]]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 2]}], "CI": "Diospyros - Velvet Apple Tree/Velvet Apple Tree - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 10]}, {"N": 21, "V": [0, "", "Oct-Nov"]}], "CI": "Diospyros - Velvet Apple Tree/Velvet Apple Tree - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 23, "V": [0, "", "round"]}, {"N": 3, "V": [1, 0, 9]}, {"N": 11, "V": [0, "", "Color: green to reddish brown"]}]}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 32, "V": [1, 4, 12]}], "CI": "Diospyros - Velvet Apple Tree/Velvet Apple Tree - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [{"lat": "12.9491188087", "long": "77.5823297527"}], "mapregion": [["12.9491188087", "77.5823297527"], ["12.9491188087", "77.5823297527"]]}
