Orchid tree is staggeringly beautiful when in bloom - and it blooms for several months! Orchid tree grows 20-40 ft tall and 10-20 ft wide with a spreading crown of briefly deciduous leaves which are 4-6 in across and rounded with lobed ends and heart shaped bases. The leaves are shaped a little like a cow's hoof. The flowers are reminiscent of showy orchids, with five irregular, usually slightly overlapping petals in shades of magenta, lavender, purplish blue or even white. The flowers often make their first appearance in late winter while the tree is bare of leaves. The blooming period then lasts until early summer. The flowers are 3-5 in across and carried in clusters at the branch tips. A postal stamp was issued by the Indian Postal Department to commemorate this tree.\", \"Language Hindi\": \"Kachnar\", \"Grow Type\": \"Nearly Evergreen\", \"Sub Family\": \"Caesalpinioideae\", \"Fruits Info\": \"thin flat pod\", \"Language Common\": \"Orchid Tree\", \"Name\": \"Bauhinia Variegata\", \"Leaves Type\": \"2 lobed\", \"Bark Texture\": \"not rough\", \"Fruits Size\": \"30 cm\", \"Genus\": \"Bauhinia\", \"Flowers Color\": \"White\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhinia_variegata\", \"Bark Color\": \"Ashy\", \"Family\": \"Fabaceae\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Orchid%20Tree.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?6602\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-840\"], \"Leaves Info\": \"Slightly longer than broad\", \"Authority\": \"L.\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Jan-Mar, Nov-Dec\", \"Leaves Shape\": \"Camel hoof\", \"Images\": [\"White Mountain Ebony Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"Bark\", \"Branch\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Tender\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Native\": \"India\", \"Flowers Info\": \"5 narrow petals\", \"Species\": \"variegata\", \"Size\": \"Small\"}"
