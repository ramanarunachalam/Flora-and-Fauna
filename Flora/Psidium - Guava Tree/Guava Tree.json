A small tree to 33 ft (10 in) high, with spreading branches, the guava is easy to recognize because of its smooth, thin, copper-colored bark that flakes off, showing the greenish layer beneath; and also because of the attractive, \"bony\" aspect of its trunk which may in time attain a diameter of 10 in (25 cm) Faintly fragrant, the white flowers, borne singly or in small clusters in the leaf axils, are 1 in (2.5 cm) wide, with 4 or 5 white petals which are quickly shed, and a prominent tuft of perhaps 250 white stamens tipped with pale-yellow anthers. The fruit, exuding a strong, sweet, musky odor when ripe, may be round, ovoid, or pear-shaped, 2 to 4 in (5-10 cm) long, with 4 or 5 protruding floral remnants (sepals) at the apex; and thin, light-yellow skin, frequently blushed with pink.", "Flowers Color": "white", "Grow Type": "Semi Evergreen", "Name": "Guava Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Size": "10 cm", "Fruits Color": "green turning yellowish", "Genus": "Psidium", "Language Hindi": "amrod", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psidium_guajava", "Bark Color": "reddish brown", "Type": "Tree", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Guava.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?30205", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-166741"], "Family": "Myrtaceae", "Authority": "L.", "Flowers Season": "Mar-Apr", "Images": ["Guava Tree", ["0000", "0001", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf"]], "Native": "S.
