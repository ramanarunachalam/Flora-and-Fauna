{"Common Family": "pea", "Type": "Tree", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Description": "This decorative, small to medium-sized tree is deciduous, dropping its leaves only for a short period in early spring. The tree is normally multi-stemmed, but it can be pruned to form a single stem. The bark of the stem is brownish grey, rough and deeply fissured. Leaves, which are spirally arranged, are suspended from drooping branches.  The drooping, blue-mauve, fragrant, pea-like flowers hang from the branches in bunches, often covering the whole tree. Flowering time is from August to January (spring and early summer). Flowers are followed by papery, brown fruit pods, that hang from the branches in clusters, and never split to release their seeds. Being a protected tree in South Africa, wild specimens may not be removed, cut down or damaged.", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Deciduos", "Sub Family": "Faboideae", "Name": "African Wisteria Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "Gree to brownn", "Genus": "Bolusanthus", "Flowers Color": "Purple", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolusanthus_speciosus", "Bark Color": "Brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?7308", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-7127"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "(Bolus) Harms", "Flowers Season": "Feb", "Images": ["African Wisteria Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "0020", "0021", "0022", "0023", "0024", "0025", "0026", "0027", "Bark", "Branch", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower Single", "Flower", "Fruit New", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["Africa"], "Species": "speciosus", "Size": "Medium"}
