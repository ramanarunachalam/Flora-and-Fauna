It has shiny green palmate leaves with lanceolate leaflets and smooth green bark. Its showy flowers have long, narrow petals that open like a banana peel to reveal hairlike yellowish orange stamens. The tree is cultivated for its edible nuts which grow in a very large, woody pod. The nuts are light brown, striped with white. They are said to taste like peanuts, and can be eaten raw or cooked or ground into a flour to make bread. The leaves and flowers are also edible.\nThe tree grows well as a tropical ornamental in moist, frost-free areas, and can be started from seed or cutting. It is a durable plant and will adapt very well to different conditions. The pachira needs plenty of sunlight though it is important to avoid direct sunlight during the summer months as the leaves may get sunburned."]}, {"N": 37, "V": [0, "", ["India"]]}]}, {"CN": 7, "CV": [{"N": 10, "V": [0, "", "</i>Malabar chestnut, Guiana chestnut, Provision tree, Saba nut, Money tree</i>"]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 2]}], "CI": "Pachira - Fortune Tree/Fortune Tree - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 7]}, {"N": 43, "V": [0, "", "Sep-Dec"]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: white with dark pink tips"]}], "CI": "Pachira - Fortune Tree/Fortune Tree - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 47, "V": [0, "", "oval"]}, {"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 2]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: green to brown"]}]}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 59, "V": [1, 4, 13]}], "CI": "Pachira - Fortune Tree/Fortune Tree - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [{"lat": "12.9501931494", "long": "77.5854117902"}, {"lat": "12.959710468962017", "long": "77.56947638912874"}, {"lat": "12.959808151735514", "long": "77.56946849265631"}], "mapregion": [["12.9501931494", "77.56946849265631"], ["12.959808151735514", "77.5854117902"]]}
