{"Common Family": "Sunflower", "Type": "Tree", "Description": "Vernonia amygdalina, a member of the Asteraceae family, is a small shrub that grows in the tropical Africa. V. amygdalina is commonly called bitter leaf because of its bitter taste. The leaves may be consumed either as a vegetable (macerated leaves in soups) or aqueous extracts as tonics for the treatment of various illnesses. In the wild, chimpanzees have been observed to ingest the leaves when suffering from parasitic infections.[1] Many herbalists and naturopathic doctors recommend aqueous extracts for their patients as treatment for emesis, nausea, diabetes, loss of appetite-induced abrosia, dysentery and other gastrointestinal tract problems. Until the last decade or so, there were only anecdotal reports and claims to support the health benefits. The anecdotal reports are now being supported by scientific evidence that a V. amygdalina regimen or consumption as dietary supplements may provide multiple health benefits.", "Where": ["1st Cross Road, II Stage, Domlur, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Evergreen", "Name": "Bitterleaf Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "unknown", "Genus": "Vernonia", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernonia_amygdalina", "Bark Color": "brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?41197", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/gcc-2949"], "Family": "Asteraceae", "Leaves Info": "serrated", "Authority": "Delile", "Height": "15m", "Flowers Season": "Feb-Mar", "Images": ["Bitterleaf Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "0018", "0019", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower Bud", "Flower", "Leaf Falling", "Leaf New", "Leaf"]], "Native": "Central Africa", "Species": "amygdalina", "Size": "Small"}
