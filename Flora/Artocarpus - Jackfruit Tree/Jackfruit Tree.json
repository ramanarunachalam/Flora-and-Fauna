Jackfruit is most probably native of the rain-forests of the Western Ghats. In fact, the name Jackfruit is derived from the malayalam name chakka. The tree is handsome and stately, 30-70 ft tall, with evergreen, alternate, glossy, somewhat leathery leaves to 9 in long, oval on mature trees, sometimes oblong or deeply lobed on young shoots. All parts contain a sticky, white latex. Short, stout flowering twigs emerge from the trunk and large branches, or even from the soil-covered base of very old trees. Tiny male flowers are borne in oblong clusters 2-4 in in length; the female flower clusters are elliptic or rounded. Largest of all tree-borne fruits, the jackfruit may be 8-to 3 ft long and 6-20 in wide, and the weight ranges from 10-50 kg. The \\\"rind' or exterior of the compound or aggregate fruit is green or yellow when ripe and composed of numerous hard, cone-like points attached to a thick and rubbery, pale yellow or whitish wall. The interior consists of large \\\"bulbs\\\" of yellow, banana-flavored flesh, massed among narrow ribbons of thin, tough undeveloped perianths, and a central, pithy core. Each bulb encloses a smooth, oval, light-brown \\\"seed\\\" covered by a thin white membrane. There may be 100 or up to 500 seeds in a single fruit. When fully ripe, the unopened jackfruit emits a strong disagreeable odor, resembling that of decayed onions, while the pulp of the opened fruit smells of pineapple and banana.\", \"Type\": \"Tree\", \"Grow Type\": \"Evergreen\", \"Name\": \"Jackfruit Tree\", \"Leaves Type\": \"Oval\", \"Fruits Size\": \"Gigantic\", \"Fruits Color\": \"Yellowish green\", \"Genus\": \"Artocarpus\", \"Language Hindi\": \"Katthal, kantthal\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackfruit\", \"Bark Color\": \"Grey\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Jackfruit.html\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?70095\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2653982\"], \"Family\": \"Moraceae\", \"Authority\": \"Lam.\", \"Height\": \"20 m\", \"Flowers Season\": \"Oct-Dec\", \"Bark Texture\": \"cracked\", \"Images\": [\"Jackfruit Tree\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"0003\", \"0004\", \"0005\", \"0006\", \"0007\", \"0008\", \"0009\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"Bark\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud 1\", \"Flower Bud 2\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Bunch\", \"Fruit New\", \"Fruit Tender\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf Falling\", \"Leaf New\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Flowers Shape\": \"White\", \"Native\": \"India\", \"Species\": \"Heterophyllus\", \"Size\": \"Medium\"}"
