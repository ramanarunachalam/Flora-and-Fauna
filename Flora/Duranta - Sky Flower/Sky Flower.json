"{\"Common Family\": \"verbena\", \"Type\": \"Shrub\", \"Fruits Shape\": \"berry like\", \"Genus\": \"Duranta\", \"Description\": \"This large, fast-growing, multistemmed shrub is popular as a screen or background planting, but is too vigorous and tall to use against the foundation or in small areas. The full clusters of fragrant, pale blue flowers attract butterflies in summer and are followed by bunches of golden-orange berries, popular with birds. Flowers and fruit are often found on the plant simultaneously and make an attractive show. Yellow fruit often hangs on the plant into the winter if the birds don't eat them. A native of tropical America introduced to Southeast Asia in relatively recent years, the shrub may grow several meters tall but is generally smaller.\", \"Where\": [\"Cambridge Road, Ulsoor, Bangalore\"], \"Grow Type\": \"Perennial\", \"Language Common\": \"Sky flower, Golden Dew Drop, Pigeon Berry\", \"Name\": \"Sky Flower\", \"Leaves Type\": \"ovate\", \"Fruits Color\": \"golden\", \"Introduced\": \"Sky Flower\", \"Flowers Color\": \"blue\", \"Wiki\": \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duranta erecta\", \"Bark Color\": \"green\", \"Links\": [\"http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Sky%20Flower.html\"], \"Family\": \"Verbenaceae\", \"Authority\": \"L.\", \"Images\": [\"Sky Flower\", [\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0002\", \"Bark\", \"Canopy\", \"Flower Bud\", \"Flower\", \"Fruit Tender\", \"Fruit\", \"Leaf\"]], \"Native\": \"Asia\", \"Species\": \"erecta\", \"Size\": \"Small\"}"
