It is a fast-growing deciduous tree that generally reaches 10 to 20 m in height and has a straight to somewhat curved stem, smoothish light brown to light greenish gray bark, and a spreading thin crown. It grows best on very moist, alluvial sites of well-drained loams or clays but can tolerate shallow, dry, stony, and sandy soils. Leaves about 40 cm long; pinnae about 4\u201312, 15\u201320 cm long; leaflets 12\u201320, oblong-elliptic, rounded or retuse, 2\u20135 cm long, oblique. Flowering generally occurs during the rainy season. The distinctly fragrant (suggesting molasses) flowers form whitish glo- bose heads 20 to 24 mm in diameter, borne on racemes 8 to 25 cm long near the ends of twigs. The fruits are flattened pods 10 to 20 cm long and 1.8 to 2.5 cm broad, changing from green to deep red or reddish brown on maturity; each contains 6 to 12 seeds. The fruits ripen 6 to 9 months after flowering, during the dry season, and usually remain on the tree until the whole twig bearing the pods is shed.", "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Mimosoideae", "Name": "White Siris Tree", "Leaves Type": "Bipinnate", "Fruits Shape": "Pod", "Fruits Size": "10 cm", "Fruits Color": "red-brown", "Genus": "Albizia", "Where": ["Lalbagh, Bangalore"], "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albizia_procera", "Bark Color": "light grey", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/White%20Siris.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?2153", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-325"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Flowers Size": "white", "Authority": "(Roxb.)
