It can grow up to a maximum of 25 m in height and 2 to 3 m in diameter, but is usually smaller. Trunks are often crooked when grown in the open. Leaves are leathery, alternate, pinnately compound and about 15 cm long. Flowers are whitish to pink, fragrant, nearly sessile, up to 1.5 cm long and in dense clusters 5-10 cm in length. Pods are oblong, flat, thin, strap-like 4-8 cm long, 1 cm wide, and light brown. They contain 1-5 flat bean-shaped seeds 8-10 mm long. They have a long taproot and numerous surface roots which produce suckers. It is primarily found growing along river banks below 900 m elevation, but can range naturally up to 1300 m. Shisham is best known internationally as a premier timber species of the rosewood genus. However, Shisham is also an important fuel wood, shade, and shelter. With its multiple products, tolerance of light frosts and long dry seasons, this species deserves greater consideration for tree farming, reforestation and agro forestry applications. After teak, it is the most important cultivated timber tree in India, planted on roadsides, and as a shade tree for tea plantations.", "Where": ["Near ESI Hospital, 7th Main Road, Indiranagar, Bangalore"], "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Sub Family": "Faboideae", "Name": "Indian Rosewood Tree", "Leaves Type": "paripinnate", "Bark Texture": "rough", "Fruits Size": "3-7 cm", "Fruits Color": "green turning pale brown", "Genus": "Dalbergia", "Flowers Color": "creamy yellow", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbergia_sissoo", "Bark Color": "Dark brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Shisham.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?13169", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/ild-1870"], "Family": "Fabaceae", "Authority": "Roxb.", "Leaflet Terminal": "3-5", "Flowers Season": "Feb-May", "Leaves Shape": "oval", "Images": ["Indian Rosewood Tree", ["0000", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011", "0012", "0013", "0014", "0015", "0016", "0017", "Bark", "Canopy", "Flower", "Fruit Bunch", "Fruit New", "Fruit Tender", "Fruit", "Leaf New", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf"]], "Native": ["India"], "Species": "Sissoo", "Size": "Medium"}
