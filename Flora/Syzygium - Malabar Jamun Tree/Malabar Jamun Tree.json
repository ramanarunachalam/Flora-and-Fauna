The terminal inflorescence is showy and usually carries four whitish-green flowers on the outside of the crown. The tree has long, glossy green leaves. Flowering can occur two or three times per year. The fruits are whitish-green, rose scented, about 5 cm long and ripen over an extended period. The edible fruit is shaped like a small pear. The flesh is a bit softer than that of an apple. It tastes like a cross between apple and watermelon, with a very mild rose scent and a slightly bitter aftertaste. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but is naturalized in India, especially the state of Kerala. In ancient Sanskrit, the land now called India was referred to by the ancient Indians themselves as Jambudvipa, which means Rose-apple-land (jambu = rose apple; dvipa = land). The dry, crisp fresh fruit is used to make jellies. Fruit/seed can be produced following self-pollination.", "Type": "Tree", "Grow Type": "Nearly Evergreen", "Language Common": "indian blackberry, jambolan, black plum", "Name": "Malabar Jamun Tree", "Leaves Type": "oval", "Fruits Color": "green turning deep purple", "Genus": "Syzygium", "Flowers Color": "white", "Wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_jambos", "Bark Color": "Pale brown", "Links": ["http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Malabar%20Plum.html", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?50070", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-22107492"], "Family": "Myrtaceae", "Authority": "(L.)
