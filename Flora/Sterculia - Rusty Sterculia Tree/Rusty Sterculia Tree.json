The distinction is in the stems, inflorescences, petioles and underside of leaves being reddish/brownish scurfy-hairy due to minute course stellate hairs (see images below). The pinkish hairy flowers form in racemes and each flower has 5 sepals joined (fused) together at the top forming a bell shape. The fruits are scarlet velvety bi-valve pods splitting open to reveal small dark blue-black seeds.  The flowers are said to be pollinated by flies and beetles, however here we have pictures of the flowers being visited by eager bees. The leaves are spirally arranged with the larger leaves at the bottom getting smaller towards the top. This attarctive small tree was observed flowering in January 2012, we expect an equally impressive display of fruit pods around March."]}, {"N": 30, "V": [0, "", "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterculia_rubiginosa\nhttp://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2580018\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a>"]}, {"N": 37, "V": [0, "", ["India"]]}]}, {"CN": 0, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 5]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: gray"]}], "CI": "Sterculia - Rusty Sterculia Tree/Rusty Sterculia Tree - Bark.jpg"}, {"CN": 3, "CV": [{"N": 5, "V": [1, 0, 6]}, {"N": 43, "V": [0, "", "Sep-Oct"]}, {"N": 18, "V": [0, "", "Color: scarlet"]}], "CI": "Sterculia - Rusty Sterculia Tree/Rusty Sterculia Tree - Flower.jpg"}, {"CN": 4, "CV": [{"N": 45, "V": [0, "", "boat"]}], "CI": "Sterculia - Rusty Sterculia Tree/Rusty Sterculia Tree - Fruit.jpg"}, {"CN": 8, "CV": [{"N": 59, "V": [1, 4, 11]}], "CI": "Sterculia - Rusty Sterculia Tree/Rusty Sterculia Tree - Leaf.jpg"}], "mapinfo": [{"lat": "12.94901008", "long": "77.59026794"}, {"lat": "12.952617002127099", "long": "77.58357234701327"}, {"lat": "12.975211009992575", "long": "77.59203833961487"}], "mapregion": [["12.94901008", "77.58357234701327"], ["12.975211009992575", "77.59203833961487"]]}
