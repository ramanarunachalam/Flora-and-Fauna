The alternate leaves have long petioles and are heart shaped with pointed tips. They are leathery, whitish and pubescent beneath, and 4-8 in long. The blossoms of Sea Hibiscus are typical Hibiscus flowers: funnel shaped with five petals and a prominent central column which bears the stamens and the pistil. They are bright yellow with a deep red centre upon opening. Over the course of the day, the flowers deepen to orange and finally red before they fall. The branches of the tree often curve over time and the wood has been used for seacraft construction, firewood, wood carving and many other uses. The inner bark of the tree has been used by Hawaiian Polynesians to make rope. This tree has been widely used as a bonsai in many Asian countries, particularly in Taiwan.", "Genus": "Hibiscus", "Type": "Tree", "Species": "tiliaceus var. tiliaceus", "Native": "India"}
