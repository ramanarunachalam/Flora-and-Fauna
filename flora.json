The leaves are of two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves 8-15 mm long on seedlings, and adult scale-leaves 0.5-3 mm long on older plants, arranged in decussate pairs or whorls of three. It is largely dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some individual plants produce both sexes. The cones are berry-like, 4-8 mm in diameter, blue-black with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 2-5 seeds; they are mature in 12-18 months. The male cones are 3-5 mm long, and shed their pollen in early spring.  It is the only juniper to occur south of the equator, and is thought to be a relatively recent colonist of Africa; the species shows very little of the variability associated with a long period of evolution (Farjon 2005).

These persistent fruits turn black when ripe and split open, revealing bright red seeds surrounded by a black, resinous material. The seeds are very attractive to birds and other wildlife and they germinate readily in the landscape and surrounding areas.

It is only during December-January, appearance of tennis-ball shaped fluffy flower heads makes one realise that this tree has to be Parkia! In the winter season, 1.5 - 2 ft branches, hanging from the leaf axil, bear rust coloured bead-like flower heads, which gradually gain size of a tennis ball and the \"flowers\" bloom to spectacular white electric bulbs! The flowers in round white heads are prominent, hence the native name 'Chendul', or ball. Leaves bipinnate with very numerous leaflets; rachis of leaf downy, 1 ft. of more long; pinnae 20-30 pair, 60 to 100 pairs leaflets, rigid, 1/4 in. long. Presence of two glands at the base of leaf, lends this species the name, biglandulosa. It is an avenue tree in Chennai. This can grow into a large tree indeed with many spreading branches. The leaves are fine and feathery. The inflorescence is similar to a Badminton Ball hanging at the tip of a long thick stalk - the reason for its common name. The fruits that are flat are in clusters at the tip of long thick stalks. Known to grow quite fast. The entire inflorescence has a very soft appearance.

A single tree thus may spread over a large area and look like a small forest. This tree is considered to be sacred in some places in India. A specimen in the Calcutta botanical garden is more than 100 years old. It has a main trunk 13 feet (4 m) in diameter, 230 trunks as large as oak trees, and more than 3,000 smaller ones. The largest banyan tree known is on the island of Sri Lanka. It has 350 large trunks and over 3,000 small ones. The banyan often grows to a height of over 21 meters and lives through many ages. Perhaps the most amazing part of this extraordinary tree is its flower. What we think of as the fruit is really a hollow, flower-bearing structure called a cyconia.

The fruit, called \"monkey bread\", is rich in vitamin C and is eaten. The tree is capable of storing hundreds of litres of water, which is tapped in dry periods. Mature trees are frequently hollow, providing living space for numerous animals and humans alike. Trees are even used as bars, barns, wine and beer shops and more. Radio-carbon dating has measured that age of some Baobab trees at over 2,000 years old.

Although carissa karanda can be kept clipped into a shrub, it really prefers to act much like a vine similar to bougainvillea and will climb to the tops of rather tall trees. Small fragrant three-quarter-inch white flowers, with rose stalk, are produced from early spring through late fall and the clusters of small purplish to black fruit ripen from May through October. Fruit size is variable, but most fruits are about three-quarters of an inch in diameter with a few seeds. Fruits usually occur in clusters somewhat resembling large purple grapes.

Ifit is a medium to large, slow growing, evergreen tree. At maturity, it ranges in height from 7 to 45 m tall, but rarely exceeds 25 m in Guam. The trunk is usually 0.5 to 5m, crooked, and often buttresses at the base. The buttresses are formed by woody roots expanding vertically creating radial walls extending from the sides of the trunk . The rooting system allows the tree to cover large areas containing rocks and thin soil, reduce competition, and increase its resistance to uprooting during cyclones.  The wood is strong and reddish brown with the heartwood yellow to orange brown. It has a high resistance to attacks by termites. Aging bark is red or bronze. The bark contains tannins, and a dye can be extracted from both the wood and bark.  The crown in full sunlight is usually upright, however, under shady conditions the crown will spread. The alternate compound leaves are 7-15 cm long, with 1-2 pairs of opposite, broadly elliptic to subrotund dark green coriaceous leaflets, each about 8-12 cm long and 5-8 cm wide on short petiolules, apex obtuse, and slightly symmetric sides.  Flowers grow in puberulent, terminal clusters of corymbose panicles, 6-10 cm long. Single petals are white, or slightly pinkish, with three stamens. The filaments are about 2.5 cm long.  The fruit are long, thick, rigid, leathery, oblong or pear-shaped green pods up to 30 cm long and 10 cm wide, which become dark brown at maturity. Each pod can contain 2 to 8 seeds varying in size and shape from round to slightly kidney shape.  Distribution: Ifit is native from the Indian Ocean eastward to Polynesia.

New branches emerging from the shallowly fissured grayish brown trunk are smooth and green. Twigs are usually green, but may be tinged with red when young. The inconspicuous tiny cream colored flowers are borne in the spring on branching 3 in flower stalks. They are followed by large crops of fruit, comprised of round pea sized berries attached to the branchlets by cuplike little green cones. The berries first turn reddish, then ripen to black.

What appears to be the fruit of the cashew tree is an oval or pear-shaped accessory fruit or false fruit that develops from the receptacle of the cashew flower. The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney or boxing-glove shaped drupe that grows at the end of the pseudofruit. Actually, the drupe develops first on the tree, and then the peduncle expands into the pseudofruit. Within the true fruit is a single seed, the cashew nut. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense the fruit of the cashew is a seed. However, the true fruit is classified as a nut by some botanists. The seed is surrounded by a double shell containing a caustic phenolic resin, urushiol, a potent skin irritant toxin also found in the related poison ivy.

The yellowish or purplish flowers are tiny, fragrant and have 5 petals. The bilimbi fruit's form ranges from ellipsoid to almost cylindrical. Its length is 4-10 cm. The bilimbi is 5-sided, but in a less marked way than the carambola. If unripe, it is bright green and crispy. It turns yellowish as it ripens. The flesh is juicy, green and extremely acidic. The fruit's skin is glossy and very thin. The bilimbi is too acid for eating raw but the green uncooked fruits are prepared as a relish in Suriname.

In Somali, it is called ghalab; in Arabic, the name is damas.Commonly found in residential compounds in Dubai UAE. The tree's wood is dense and suitable for charcoal. Goats use the young trees and shoots as fodder, although the leaves contain tannin. Because of its high salt tolerance and relative drought tolerance, the tree is sometimes planted as a pioneer species in reafforestation projects in its native habitat. The tree has a symmetrical growth habit and can easily be shaped into a variety of different forms. It can be shaped into short and tall hedges, and is effective for creating a visual or a noise barrier. With suitable plant spacing it can also be grown as a hardy single-stemmed tree which is good for shade.

In 2007 studies on the genus Tabebuia determined it to be polyphyletic (because as it has stood it includes Crescentia, Spirotecoma, and Ekmanianthe) with the solution being to split some members of the genus, including the two species commonly grown in California, into the new genus Handroanthus. Plants so separated can be distinguished from true Tabebuia based on the fact that they all have minute hairs on the leaves and flowers. Because of this, Tabebuia chrysotricha becomes Handroanthus chrysotrichus, and Tabebuia impetiginosa becomes Handroanthus impetiginosus.

There are curved spines (really more like prickles) on the long leaf stalks too. The leaves are compound, with three diamond shaped leaflets, each about 6 in long. Before the leaves come out in late winter or early spring, coral tree puts on a spectacular show with bright crimson flowers 2-3 in long in dense terminal clusters. It may flower a little during the summer, too. The beanlike pods that follow the flowers are cylindrical, about 15 in long, and constricted between the reddish brown seeds.

Tall and straight, with comparatively few branches, its popularity lies in its ornamental value. It is a fine tree, fast growing, but with brittle wood, liable to be damaged by storms. In favourable positions it can grow to 24 m tall. The ashy bark is cracked and furrowed and the numerous fissures make removal of the cork an easy matter. It is used as an inferior substitute for true cork. From April until the rains and again in November and December, a profusion of silvery-white, delightfully fragrant flowers crown the foliage. Upright open clusters with arching blooms terminate every branchlet. Each flower is a tiny bell-shaped calyx, a long slender tube of palest green dividing into four waxy, white petals and several conspicuous yellow anthered stamens. Many flowers are delicately tinted with rose. As the flowers are short-lived, the flower sprays mostly consist largely of long whitish buds, while the ground below is spangled with innumerable little stars. Between January and March the leaves are shed and renewed during April and May, although the tree is never quite naked. The long leaves bear two or three widely spaced pinnae, each with five or seven smooth leaflets, oval, pointed and slightly round-toothed. Each is from 2.5 to 7.5 cm. long. Sometimes the lower pinnae, are again divided and bear one pair of three leaved pinnae, one or two pairs of leaflets and one leaflet at the end. The fruit is very long and narrow, pointed at both ends and contains thin flat seeds. Trees do not seed very easily in India.

Pods are oblong, flat, thin, strap-like 4-8 cm long, 1 cm wide, and light brown. They contain 1-5 flat bean-shaped seeds 8-10 mm long. They have a long taproot and numerous surface roots which produce suckers. It is primarily found growing along river banks below 900 m elevation, but can range naturally up to 1300 m. Shisham is best known internationally as a premier timber species of the rosewood genus. However, Shisham is also an important fuel wood, shade, and shelter.

Rubber Tree is popular because it is very easy to grow and care for. They can get big pretty quickly, as they are vigorous growers and don't ask for much attention.

Leaf size is largest on young plants (occasionally to 45 cm long), much smaller on old trees (typically 10 cm long). The leaves develop inside a reddish sheath at the tip of branches, which looks very attractive. It grows larger as the new leaf develops. When it is mature, it unfurls and the sheath drops off the plant. Inside the new leaf, another immature leaf is waiting to develop. The small stalkless, yellow-green oval figs, 1 cm long, grow in pairs. This is a popular house-plant, and grows in all Indian conditions. The tree can yield a milky white latex, which has been used to make rubber.", "Where": ["bangalore"], "Native": ["India"]}, "Language": {"Assamese": ["\u0985\u09a5\u09be \u09ac\u09f0", "Atha bor"], "Hindi": ["\u0930\u092c\u0930 \u092a\u0947\u0921\u093c"], "Kannada": ["\u0cb0\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cb0\u0ccd \u0cae\u0cb0", "Goli", "Goni", "Shimeala", "India rubber mara"], "Khasi": ["Diengjri"], "Malayalam": ["\u0d31\u0d2c\u0d4d\u0d2c\u0d7c \u0d2e\u0d30\u0d02", "Shimayal", "Simayal"], "Marathi": ["\u0930\u092c\u0930\u093e\u091a\u094b \u0935\u0921", "Rabracho-vad"], "Tamil": ["\u0b9a\u0bc0\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b86\u0bb2 \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd", "\u0b9a\u0bc0\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b86\u0bb2\u0bcd"], "Telugu": ["\u0c30\u0c2c\u0c4d\u0c2c\u0c30\u0c41", "Rabbaru", "Sagubanka", "Simamarri"]}, "Images": ["Indian Rubber Tree", "Fig", ["Fig Tender", "Fig", "Canopy", "Leaf New", "Leaf Tender", "Leaf", "Bark", "0000", "Aerial Root", "0001", "0002", "0003", "0004", "0005", "0006", "0007", "0008", "0009", "0010", "0011"]], "Places": ["bangalore", "india"]}, "Euphorbia - Indian Spurge Tree": {"Info": {"Name": "Indian Spurge Tree", "Type": "Tree", "Family": "Euphorbiaceae", "Genus": "Euphorbia", "Species": "neriifolia", "Authority": "L.", "Common Family": "amla", "Common Sub Family": "castor", "Size": "Small", "Grow Type": "Evergreen"}, "Language": {"Bengali": ["Manasasi", "Sij"], "English": ["Hedge euphorbia", "Oleander spurge"], "Hindi": ["\u0921\u0902\u0921\u093e \u0920\u094c\u0930 \u092a\u0947\u0921\u093c", "\u0925\u094b\u0930", "Danda thaur", "Danda thor", "Sehund", "Katathohar", "Senhur", "Sij", "Thor"], "Kannada": ["Elegalli", "Elekalli", "Ilaikalli", "Dubbakalli", "Dundukalli elegalli", "Gutagalli"], "Malayalam": ["Elakkalli", "Ilaikalli", "Ilakalli", "Ela-calli"], "Marathi": ["Mingut", "Nevagunda", "Newrang", "Thor", "Nivarang", "Seej"], "Odiya": ["Thor", "Kantalothor", "Svarasana"], "Sanskrit": ["Gudha", "Nagarika", "Nanda", "Nistrinsapatra", "Patrasnuhi", "Adhoguda", "Gandira", "Guda", "Mahavrksha"], "Tamil": ["\u0b87\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3\u0bbf \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd", "Elaikalli", "Perumbu kalli", "Ilakalli", "Manjevi", "Nanangalli"], "Telugu": ["Aku-jemudu", "Akujamudu", "Akukalli", "Bonthajamudu"], "Urdu": ["Thuhar"]}, "Bark": {"Color": "Grey", "Info": "thorny"}, "Spines": {"Color": "black"}, "Leaves": {"Type": "Obovate", "Texture": "Leathery"}, "Flowers": {"Color": "Green and Red", "Season": "Jan-Feb"}, "Fruits": {"Size": "12 mm", "Shape": "capsule", "Color": "red or pale brown", "Info": "3 lobed"}, "Misc": {"Links": [["wikipedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia_neriifolia"], ["flowersofindia", "http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Indian%20Spurge%20Tree.html"], ["ars-grin", "http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?16390"], ["theplantlist", "http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-81079"]], "Description": "Indian Spurge Tree is a succulent plant with twisting columnar branches.

These stalks are green or pink and furry, about 5 cm. long. The plum-coloured calyx is also furry and divides into four or five lobes; within them lies the globular corolla, thick, juicy and creamy white. Through small eyelet holes at the top, the yellow anthers can be seen. The stamens are very short and adhere to the inner surface of the corolla; the pistil is a long, protruding green tongue.

It is the state tree of Andhra Pradesh. Neem is a fast growing tree that can reach a height of 15-20 m, rarely to 35-40 m. It is evergreen but under severe drought it may shed most or nearly all of its leaves. The branches are wide spread. The fairly dense crown is roundish or oval and may reach the diameter of 15-20 m in old, free-standing specimens. The trunk is relatively short, straight and may reach a diameter of 1.2 m. The bark is hard, fissured or scaly, and whitish-grey to reddish-brown. The sapwood is greyish-white and the heartwood reddish when first exposed to the air becoming reddish-brown after exposure. The root system consists of a strong taproot and well developed lateral roots. The alternate, pinnate leaves are 20-40 cm long, with 20-31 medium to dark green leaflets about 3-8 cm long. The shape of mature leaflets is more or less asymmetric and their margins are serrated. The flowers (white and fragrant) are arranged axillary, normally more-or-less drooping panicles which are up to 25 cm long. The inflorescences, which branch up to the third degree, bear 150-250 flowers. An individual flower is 5-6 mm long and 8-11 mm wide.The fruit is a glabrous olive-like drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish, and when ripe are 1.4-2.8 x 1.0-1.5 cm. But Neem is far more than a tough tree that grows vigorously in difficult sites.

It is palm tree, one of the Sugar palm group, found from Indonesia to Pakistan. The palmyra palm is a large tree up to 30m high and the trunk may have a circumference of 1.7m at the base. There may be 25-40 fresh leaves. Leaves are leathery, gray green, fan-shaped, 1-3 m wide, folded along the midrib; are divided to the center into 60-80 linear- lanceolate, 0.6-1.2 m long, marginally spiny segments. Their strong, stalks, 1-1.2 m long, are edged with hard spines. In India, it is planted as a windbreak on the plains. It is also used as a natural shelter by birds, bats and wild animals. The flowers are produced in big clusters of long, white string-like inflorences. The coconut-like fruits are three-sided when young, becoming rounded or more or less oval, 12-15 cm wide, and capped at the base with overlapping sepals. When the fruit is very young, this kernel is hollow, soft as jelly, and translucent like ice, and is accompanied by a watery liquid, sweetish and potable. The chief product of the palmyra is the sweet sap (toddy) obtained by tapping the tip of the inflorescence, as is done with the other sugar palms and, to a lesser extent, with the coconut. The toddy ferments naturally within a few hours after sunrise and is locally popular as a beverage. Rubbing the inside of the toddy-collecting receptacle with lime paste prevents fermentation, and thereafter the sap is referred to as sweet toddy, which yields concentrated or crude sugar (gur in India; jaggery in Ceylon); molasses, palm candy, and vinegar. Palmyra palm jaggery (gur) is much more nutritious than crude cane sugar. Traditionally, the Indian 'Nadar' community are the people who make their living from this tree using its wood, fruits, sap, stems, petioles and leaves to process a variety of food products, beverages, furniture, building materials, and handicrafts.", "Where": ["bangalore"], "Native": ["S.

The flowers are reminiscent of showy orchids, with five irregular, usually slightly overlapping petals in shades of magenta, lavender, purplish blue or even white. The flowers often make their first appearance in late winter while the tree is bare of leaves. The blooming period then lasts until early summer.

Semul trees bear beautiful red-colored flowers during January to March. The phenomenon paints the whole landscape in an enchanting red hue. The fruit, the size of a ping-pong ball, on maturity appears during March and April. These are full of cotton-like fibrous stuff. It is for the fiber that villagers gather the semul fruit and extract the cotton substance called \"kopak\". This substance is used for filling economically priced pillows, quilts, sofas etc. The fruit is cooked and eaten and also pickled. Semul is quite a fast growing tree and can attain a girth of 2 to 3 m, and height about 30 m, in nearly 50 years or so. Its wood, when sawn fresh, is white in color. However, with exposure and passage of time it grows darkish gray. It is as light as 10 to 12 kg, per cubic foot. It is easy to work but not durable anywhere other than under water. So it is popular for construction work, but is very good and prized for manufacture of plywood, match boxes and sticks, scabbards, patterns, moulds, etc. Also for making canoes and light duty boats and or other structures required under water.

In its native range, its small fruit are a favorite food of some birds. It is a very popular house plant, due to its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best under bright, sunny conditions but will also tolerate considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer, and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. It does not need to be misted.

The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.

The crown is compact and shapely. Flowers are usually to be seen throughout the year, but it is in January and February that the profusion of orange and scarlet clusters turns the tree into an object of startling beauty. Pinned closely on to every branch and twig, these clusters consist of numerous, small, long-tubed flowers which open out into four oval lobes. Yellow when young, they become orange then crimson with age and from the effect of the sun's rays. From a ring at the top of each tube spread several long, half-white, half-crimson, stamens which give an hairy appearance to the flower clusters. In strong contrast to these fiery blooms is the deep-green, shiny foliage. The foot-long leaves each have four, five or six pairs of long, wavy-edged, leaflets.

The flower stalks are green or pink and furry, about 5 cm. long. The plum-coloured calyx is also furry and divides into four or five lobes; within them lies the globular corolla, thick, juicy and creamy white. Through small eyelet holes at the top, the yellow anthers can be seen. The stamens are very short and adhere to the inner surface of the corolla; the pistil is a long, protruding green tongue.

Fiddlewood is tolerant of sandy, dry soil and adapts to a wide range of soil pH including alkaline. Moderate salt tolerance allows planting near the beach.

The genus name Phyllanthus is derived from Greek words meaning leaf-flower, an allusion to the apparent bearing of flowers on the leaves. The species name acidus is on account of the acidity of the fruit. Flowers are very minute, in short dense spike-like clusters arising from nodules along the branches, like mulberries. Fruit is pendulous, in small clusters from the branches, round or slightly flattened at the poles, with shallow or deep ribs (usually 5) 0.75 inch across. The tree usually flowers and produces fruit twice a year. Fruits appear simultaneously with the flowers. So, the tree usally has fruits hanging from it, at any time of the year. The fruit is used chiefly for pickling and for the preparation of preserves. It makes an excellent jam.

The tree can get 90 ft tall but is usually less than 50 ft. It has a short, stocky trunk, drooping branches and a domed umbrella shaped crown about as wide as the tree's height. The leaves are about 10 in long with 10-18 pairs of 1 in oblong leaflets. Tamarind drops its leaves in pronounced dry seasons; in climates without a dry season it stays evergreen. The flowers are about 1 in across, pale yellow with purple or red veins. They have five unequal lobes and borne in small drooping clusters. The velvety cinnamon brown pods are 2-6 in long, sausage shaped and constricted between the seeds. The pulp that surrounds the 8-10 seeds is both sweet and extremely sour, and girls in India love it. It is common to have a tamarind tree in the compound of a girls hostel. Tamarind is very much used in cooking in India, particularly in the south.

It was introduced into India so long ago that it has often been reported as indigenous here, and it was apparently from India that it reached the Persians and the Arabs who called it \"tamar hind\" (Indian date, from the date-like appearance of the dried pulp), giving rise to both its common and generic name.

The branches grow in horizontal tiers, and spread widely. The crown has an open umbrella shape. Many plants and animals grow and live in the branches of the kapok tree. Birds nest in it, and mammals use the huge branches as highways. Frogs breed in the pools of water that collect in the bromeliads. The leaves are palmate and compound. The 5-9 leaflets are 7-8 cm long and 1-3.5 cm wide. Flowers usually open before the leaves appear, and are clustered on small, new branches.

It is a very popular house plant, due to its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best under bright, sunny conditions but will also tolerate considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer, and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its situation, and may need drastic pruning or replacing. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.

The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its situation, and may need drastic pruning or replacing. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.
