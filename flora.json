The soft singing of the air through its innumerable slender twigs is a pleasant sound, which lends it the common name Whistling Pine. It is a large vase-shaped tree that grows 100-150 ft in height with wispy grey green twigs reminiscent of pine needles. The weeping branchlets look a little like jointed rushes and are ringed at their nodes by tightly overlapping little scalelike leaves. The stout trunk is covered with thick pebbly textured brownish grey bark. The male flowers are borne in slender cylindrical spikes at the twig tips. The tiny brownish red female flowers grow in heads attached to the branchlets and are followed by 0.5 in diameter fruits that resemble pinecones and contain 70-90 winged seeds each. The wood is hard and is almost unworkable by carpenters. It also cracks and splits easily and so is more suitable for beams or posts than planks, but does not last long underground.

The genus name Phyllanthus is derived from Greek words meaning leaf-flower, an allusion to the apparent bearing of flowers on the leaves. The species name acidus is on account of the acidity of the fruit. Flowers are very minute, in short dense spike-like clusters arising from nodules along the branches, like mulberries. Fruit is pendulous, in small clusters from the branches, round or slightly flattened at the poles, with shallow or deep ribs (usually 5) 0.75 inch across.

A specimen in the Calcutta botanical garden is more than 100 years old. It has a main trunk 13 feet (4 m) in diameter, 230 trunks as large as oak trees, and more than 3,000 smaller ones. The largest banyan tree known is on the island of Sri Lanka. It has 350 large trunks and over 3,000 small ones. The banyan often grows to a height of over 21 meters and lives through many ages. Perhaps the most amazing part of this extraordinary tree is its flower. What we think of as the fruit is really a hollow, flower-bearing structure called a cyconia.

The genus name Salmalia is derived from the sanskrit name shaalmali. Silk cotton trees comprise eight species in the genus Bombax, native to India, tropical southern Asia, northern Australia and tropical Africa. Semul trees bear beautiful red-colored flowers during January to March. The phenomenon paints the whole landscape in an enchanting red hue. The fruit, the size of a ping-pong ball, on maturity appears during March and April. These are full of cotton-like fibrous stuff. It is for the fiber that villagers gather the semul fruit and extract the cotton substance called \\\"kopak\\\". This substance is used for filling economically priced pillows, quilts, sofas etc. The fruit is cooked and eaten and also pickled. Semul is quite a fast growing tree and can attain a girth of 2 to 3 m, and height about 30 m, in nearly 50 years or so. Its wood, when sawn fresh, is white in color. However, with exposure and passage of time it grows darkish gray. It is as light as 10 to 12 kg, per cubic foot. It is easy to work but not durable anywhere other than under water. So it is popular for construction work, but is very good and prized for manufacture of plywood, match boxes and sticks, scabbards, patterns, moulds, etc. Also for making canoes and light duty boats and or other structures required under water.

In 2007 studies on the genus Tabebuia determined it to be polyphyletic (because as it has stood it includes Crescentia, Spirotecoma, and Ekmanianthe) with the solution being to split some members of the genus, including the two species commonly grown in California, into the new genus Handroanthus. Plants so separated can be distinguished from true Tabebuia based on the fact that they all have minute hairs on the leaves and flowers. Because of this, Tabebuia chrysotricha becomes Handroanthus chrysotrichus, and Tabebuia impetiginosa becomes Handroanthus impetiginosus.

The trunk is usually 0.5 to 5m, crooked, and often buttresses at the base. The buttresses are formed by woody roots expanding vertically creating radial walls extending from the sides of the trunk . The rooting system allows the tree to cover large areas containing rocks and thin soil, reduce competition, and increase its resistance to uprooting during cyclones.  The wood is strong and reddish brown with the heartwood yellow to orange brown. It has a high resistance to attacks by termites. Aging bark is red or bronze. The bark contains tannins, and a dye can be extracted from both the wood and bark.  The crown in full sunlight is usually upright, however, under shady conditions the crown will spread. The alternate compound leaves are 7-15 cm long, with 1-2 pairs of opposite, broadly elliptic to subrotund dark green coriaceous leaflets, each about 8-12 cm long and 5-8 cm wide on short petiolules, apex obtuse, and slightly symmetric sides.  Flowers grow in puberulent, terminal clusters of corymbose panicles, 6-10 cm long. Single petals are white, or slightly pinkish, with three stamens. The filaments are about 2.5 cm long.  The fruit are long, thick, rigid, leathery, oblong or pear-shaped green pods up to 30 cm long and 10 cm wide, which become dark brown at maturity. Each pod can contain 2 to 8 seeds varying in size and shape from round to slightly kidney shape.  Distribution: Ifit is native from the Indian Ocean eastward to Polynesia.

In Somali, it is called ghalab; in Arabic, the name is damas.Commonly found in residential compounds in Dubai UAE. The tree's wood is dense and suitable for charcoal. Goats use the young trees and shoots as fodder, although the leaves contain tannin. Because of its high salt tolerance and relative drought tolerance, the tree is sometimes planted as a pioneer species in reafforestation projects in its native habitat. The tree has a symmetrical growth habit and can easily be shaped into a variety of different forms. It can be shaped into short and tall hedges, and is effective for creating a visual or a noise barrier. With suitable plant spacing it can also be grown as a hardy single-stemmed tree which is good for shade. The tree has been extensively used in Karachi for landscaping along roads and by homeowners as a tall hedging tree for screening purposes.

The leaves are simple, alternate, stipulate although the stipules drop early, and usually 3-nerved from the base. The leaf base is frequently unequal. Leaves taper from the base to the apex, and vary from 60 to 150 mm long and 25 to 50 mm wide. Leaf margins are finely serrated, and the young leaves are rough and hairy, occasionally becoming smooth when old. Flowers are small, inconspicuous and greenish, carried in short dense bunches. They are usually unisexual, i.e. male and female are separate, occasionally they are found together. Flowers appear irregularly from late winter to summer. The name Trema is based on the Greek word for hole and pertains to the pitted stone of the fruit.

It is a very popular house plant, due to its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best under bright, sunny conditions but will also tolerate considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer, and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its situation, and may need drastic pruning or replacing. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.

In its native range, its small fruit are a favorite food of some birds. It is a very popular house plant, due to its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best under bright, sunny conditions but will also tolerate considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer, and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its situation, and may need drastic pruning or replacing. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.

Individual flowers are 3 to 4 cm long, and form from January to March.  The fruit is two to four cell dry cocci. They mature from July to December, spitting down one side exposing a single shiny black flattened seed, 4 to 5 cm long. Germination is unpredictable, starting within 30 days or taking several years. Soaking the seeds for several days appears to remove some of the germination inhibitors.\", \"Where\": [\"Lalbagh, Bangalore\"], \"Grow Type\": \"Deciduos\", \"Name\": \"Pink Doughwood Tree\", \"Places\": [\"bangalore\", \"india\"], \"Leaves Type\": \"trifoliate\", \"Genus\": \"Melicope\", \"Flowers Color\": \"pink\", \"Bark Color\": \"grey\", \"Links\": [\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melicope_elleryana\", \"http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/\", \"http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?464011\", \"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-50261856\"], \"Family\": \"Rutaceae\", \"Authority\": \"(F.

The leaves are about 10 in long with 10-18 pairs of 1 in oblong leaflets. Tamarind drops its leaves in pronounced dry seasons; in climates without a dry season it stays evergreen. The flowers are about 1 in across, pale yellow with purple or red veins. They have five unequal lobes and borne in small drooping clusters. The velvety cinnamon brown pods are 2-6 in long, sausage shaped and constricted between the seeds. The pulp that surrounds the 8-10 seeds is both sweet and extremely sour, and girls in India love it. It is common to have a tamarind tree in the compound of a girls hostel. Tamarind is very much used in cooking in India, particularly in the south. Contrary to popular belief, Tamarind is not native to India. It originated in tropical Africa, including Sudan and parts of the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. It was introduced into India so long ago that it has often been reported as indigenous here, and it was apparently from India that it reached the Persians and the Arabs who called it \\\"tamar hind\\\" (Indian date, from the date-like appearance of the dried pulp), giving rise to both its common and generic name.

It is a very popular house plant, due to its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best under bright, sunny conditions but will also tolerate considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer, and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its situation, and may need drastic pruning or replacing. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.

They also have medicinal properties and cooked and eaten when suffering from rheumatism or arthritis. The young leaves come in handy as a leafy vegetable. The lettuce tree can be grown as a large shrub. Being a coastal tree it does not thrive as well on land as it does on the east and west coast of the USA. The plant grows well in any soil, but being a littoral plant it shows preference for sandy soil. It is propagated through cuttings, which root easily in sand.

It is a very popular house plant, due to its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best under bright, sunny conditions but will also tolerate considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer, and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its situation, and may need drastic pruning or replacing. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is re-located it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity.

The few suckers that it does produce can easily be pulled out by hand, or cut off with the lawn mower. The one exception to this is if the plant receives heavy pruning, either intentionally, or by storm damage. Then, as a survival tactic, it will produce many suckers.  Clerodendrum minahassae is almost an evergreen plant. It will retain its leaves year around, with the exception of a few weeks in late winter or early spring. Then it tends to drop most of its leave all at once, but puts out new growth almost immediately. It will grow to a large shrub or small tree of around 15 feet. It can be trimmed to a smaller size if desired, but trimming will initiate more root suckers.  Clerodendrum minahassae will bloom off and on at almost any time of the year. The heaviest bloom however is in the spring, with a complete cover of white tube shaped flowers. Heavy flowering last a short time, from a few weeks to a little over a month. But the flowers quickly produce seeds which are very striking. Each flower produces a single seed pod which starts out a light green, then turns to a deep, glossy black over time. The seed pod is surrounded by a large, brilliant red halo. The seed pods, with the brilliant red halo hangs on the plant for many months providing a very interesting display of color. These pictures simply does not do the tree justice.  Clerodendrum minahassae will do best in full sun, although it doesn't mind being in an area of partial shade.

Each flower is a tiny bell-shaped calyx, a long slender tube of palest green dividing into four waxy, white petals and several conspicuous yellow anthered stamens. Many flowers are delicately tinted with rose. As the flowers are short-lived, the flower sprays mostly consist largely of long whitish buds, while the ground below is spangled with innumerable little stars.

There may be 25-40 fresh leaves. Leaves are leathery, gray green, fan-shaped, 1-3 m wide, folded along the midrib; are divided to the center into 60-80 linear- lanceolate, 0.6-1.2 m long, marginally spiny segments. Their strong, stalks, 1-1.2 m long, are edged with hard spines. In India, it is planted as a windbreak on the plains. It is also used as a natural shelter by birds, bats and wild animals. The flowers are produced in big clusters of long, white string-like inflorences. The coconut-like fruits are three-sided when young, becoming rounded or more or less oval, 12-15 cm wide, and capped at the base with overlapping sepals. When the fruit is very young, this kernel is hollow, soft as jelly, and translucent like ice, and is accompanied by a watery liquid, sweetish and potable. The chief product of the palmyra is the sweet sap (toddy) obtained by tapping the tip of the inflorescence, as is done with the other sugar palms and, to a lesser extent, with the coconut. The toddy ferments naturally within a few hours after sunrise and is locally popular as a beverage. Rubbing the inside of the toddy-collecting receptacle with lime paste prevents fermentation, and thereafter the sap is referred to as sweet toddy, which yields concentrated or crude sugar (gur in India; jaggery in Ceylon); molasses, palm candy, and vinegar. Palmyra palm jaggery (gur) is much more nutritious than crude cane sugar.
