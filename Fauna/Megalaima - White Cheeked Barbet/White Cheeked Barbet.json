During the breeding season which begins at the start of summer their calls become loud and constant especially in the mornings. The call, a monotonous Kot-roo ... Kotroo... starting with an explosive trrr is not easily differentiated from that of the Brown-headed Barbet. During hot afternoons, they may also utter a single note wut not unlike the call of Collared Scops Owl or Coppersmith Barbet. Other harsh calls are produced during aggressive encounters. Close up showing the rictal bristles\\nThe head is brownish streaked with white, sometimes giving it a capped appearance. The bill is pale pinkish. The length is 165-185mm, head of 51-53mm and tail of 60-67mm.[3] Size varies from the larger northern birds to the southern ones.[4]\\nThese birds are mostly frugivorous, but will take winged termites and other insects opportunistically. They feed on the fruits of various Ficus species including Ficus benjamina and Ficus mysorensis,[5] and other introduced fruit trees such as Muntingia calabura. When foraging they are quite aggressive and will attempt to chase other barbets, Koels and other frugivores.\", \"Language Common\": \"Small Green Barbet\", \"Genus\": \"Megalaima\", \"Type\": \"Bird\", \"Species\": \"viridis\", \"Native\": \"Southern India\"}"
