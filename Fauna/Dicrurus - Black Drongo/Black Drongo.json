Adults usually have a small white spot at the base of the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar Ashy Drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are brownish and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the White-bellied Drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.\", \"Genus\": \"Dicrurus\", \"Type\": \"Bird\", \"Species\": \"macrocercus\", \"Native\": \"India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka\"}"
