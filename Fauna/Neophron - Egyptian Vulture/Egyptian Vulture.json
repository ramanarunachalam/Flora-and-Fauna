The white plumage however usually appears soiled due to the habits of the birds. The bill is slender and long and the tip of the upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The feathers on the neck are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed with the third primary being the longest. The tail is wedge shaped. The claws are long and straight and the 3rd and 4th toes are slightly webbed at the base. The bill is black in the nominate population but is pale or yellowish in the smaller Indian ginginianus, but this variation may need further study. The facial skin is yellow and unfeathered down to the throat. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown with black and white patches.[16]\\nThe adult Egyptian Vulture measures 47\\u201370 cm (21\\u201328 in) from the point of the beak to the extremity of the tail feathers and 1.5-1.7 metre (5-5.6 ft) between the tips of the wings. In N. p. ginginianus males are about 47.5-52.5 cm long while females are 52-55.5 cm long.[9] It weighs about 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs) although birds of the subspecies majorensis average 2.4 kilograms (5.3 lbs), about 18% heavier than birds from Iberia.[\", \"Genus\": \"Neophron\", \"Type\": \"Bird\", \"Species\": \"percnopterus\", \"Native\": \"Resident South Asia\"}"
