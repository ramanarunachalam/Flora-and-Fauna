The eye is blue and bare yellow facial skin during the non-breeding season. Breeding birds have a short white ear tuft. In some plumages it has a white throat but the white is restricted below the gape unlike in the much larger Great Cormorant. Sexes are similar, but non-breeding adults and juveniles are browner.", "Genus": "Phalacrocorax", "Type": "Bird", "Species": "fuscicollis", "Native": "India"}
